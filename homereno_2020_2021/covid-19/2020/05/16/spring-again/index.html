  <p>I have a new beauty product obsession - these amazing Lapcos Korean sheet masks from Costo.</p>

<p><img alt="Lapcos sheet mask variety pack" src="/assets/2020/05/16/sheetMasks-cf3527b26b0dab5c5e94f658d244d41d12e4f2e1d8b9f8806a80ae2e90486e81.jpg" /></p>

<p>I am not really one for beauty products, but I’ve been super stressed, and I was all in for a way to kick back and relax. Not to mention that living alone now, I was less concerned about any laughter having this thing plastered on my face my insue. So I bought in. The first one I tried was Cica. It was packaged in green, and I like green.</p>

<p><img alt="My first at home facial" src="/assets/2020/05/16/facialMask-263a3178c71d91e8a3d79465c3ed2036dcc62544f389a95a04fb6bcb3c78e1a2.jpg" /></p>

<p>I was a bit skeptical, but it was so amazing. It was so incredibly cooling and refreshing. I could just feel the stress melting away. Seriously people. This was life changing.</p>

<p>These were a little pricey for everyday use, but I damn well did spend every night this last week working my way through the variety pack. Cica was my favorite, as it is <strong><em>super</em></strong> cooling and claming. It helped un-rosey-red my cheeks &amp; nose! Woot! Milk and Honey were both luxuriously thick and nicely scented. Charcoal was also nice and refreshing, but didn’t have the extra bang of a nice fragrance or as cooling an effect as the cica. I’m skepitcal on the red wine, as I had a bit of a headache the next day, just like if I had drank red wine. (I can’t any more it is definitely a migraine trigger for me.)</p>

<p>I loved these so much that Then I as that I went back to Costco today to get more before they were gone. I drew the line 5 more packs, but already they were nearly gone, so I suspect there will be none next time I am there. Boo!!! I’ll be keeping my eyes out for these in the future though, and in the mean time have found you can get them on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lapcos-Mask-Cica-5-pack/dp/B07JLW82HH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DLZZTF7S1MJK&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=lapcos+cica+mask&amp;qid=1590964784&amp;sprefix=lapcos+ci%2Caps%2C159&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>This is what the Covid <em>stay at home</em> has done for me. I’ve also become a bit YouTube obsessed. I now understand Martin’s obsession with it. I’ve discovered an amazing source of mostly useless information. However, thanks to YouTube I’ve also now been sucked into <em>face yoga</em>.</p>

<p>Did I mention the stress level was running a bit high?  Well, adding this in to my routine as I wash up in the morning and wind down for the night has helped a lot to manage that.</p>

<p>I’m only a few days into this new habit, but I can already see and feel the difference in my tension filled brow. Woot! Maybe I can ditch those frown lines that have been building since high school in my 40s. This is what our Covid isolation is all about, finding your best self, right?</p>

<p>Anyhow, the highlight of today was that Martin was over again, and we got the stairs going down to the basement in. (I also sent him home with a pack of sheet masks for Miki. ^.^  Must spread the love!)</p>

<p><img alt="Stairs to the basement are in" src="/assets/2020/05/16/newStairs-2e4aaad5d81077ab9d74aea09e3c0c3a0546d6ab4d4f636de054285dbf6f1edb.jpg" /> 
Woot! It looks so nice! Now I just need the basement floor…</p>

<p>For more cheer, the crab apples are in bloom. The flowers are so lovely!

<p>My back deck is looking lovely. Makes me want to grill… ^.^

<p>So I did. I finally did my first bit of solo cooking on the Big Green Egg. Tried my hand at baking a pizza… It was a little extra crispy, but overall not bad for a first attempt.</p>

<p><img alt="My first Green Egg pizza" src="/assets/2020/05/16/veggiePizza-1db12387510903dceac4fb7891286ff904da9a4c52fedad9cdb0780efa4d4912.jpg" /></p>

<p>I struggled a lot to get the temperature up high enough. I was aiming for 425, but I never managed to get it above 350. I eventually just tossed the pizza in anyway, but then lost what heat I had when I opened it to put the pizza in. I never got it back. Doing some research it seems like having a fan to increase the airflow really helps. Setting a timer might be important too. I forget about the pizza while looking up how to manage the grill temperature, hence the extra crispy…</p>
