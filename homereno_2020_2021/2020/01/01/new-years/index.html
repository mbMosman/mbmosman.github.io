  <p>Happy New Year all! This pretty much wraps up the holidays for me. No more working from home, snuggling with the kitties. I’m back in the office the rest of the week, and class starts again Monday.</p>

<p>I didn’t do much for New Year’s Eve… I spent the morning shoveling the driveway, since it snowed yesterday. Then the rest of the day was spent cleaning up the basement to put in flooring. Got some stuff put away and everything else moved to the other side of the room.</p>

<p>The new sub-floor was of course the last delivery in the 11-3 window. It was just one guy and he wasn’t really up on what he was doing. Said at first he couldn’t get it up the driveway, but my neighbor came over to help out and we got it up and into the garage. Big thanks Jeff!!!</p>

<p>I brought some in and got the first row laid out, but decided it was too late to do any cutting. Plus I was super tired and sore. It’s a decent start though.</p>

<p><img alt="Basement cleaned up and ready to go." src="/assets/2020/01/01/cleaned-up-ad4c910582dbfbcb900e4fb9bee8a02479f223861a9bc5eef1ed479380102490.jpg" /></p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening reading a book, <a href="/book/the-subtle-knife">The Subtle Knife</a>. The neighbors set off some fireworks, and scared off my kittie cuddles. There were some others scattered around too, but it was pretty quiet overall. I was tired and sore, and it didn’t really seem much worth waiting up for New Year’s, so I just went to bed. I was still awake as the last of the fireworks went off, but not for long.</p>

<p>Martin came over this afternoon to help out with the flooring work. I decided to rip out the masonry around the base of the fireplace instead of cutting the flooring to go around it, and that took most of the afternoon. He got me hooked up with the right tools, and while I did most of the destruction - super therapeutic BTW - he keep things cleaned up and did some heavy lifting. There’s a lot of crap to get rid of now.</p>

<p><img alt="Martin prying off some stone work." src="/assets/2020/01/01/martin-pitching-in-b140898b96565ee4434235919698f6ab4666c51023c0eed941822e897740ba5b.jpg" /></p>

<p>I’m glad he came by as I probably wouldn’t have mustered the effort to do it all without him. It was quite the job. I can’t say it wasn’t built sturdy. I didn’t expect to see concrete block underneath filled with sand.</p>

<p><img alt="Close up of the base." src="/assets/2020/01/01/close-up-2c1706b9be90566578346ba6f56d6ba8417bfcd5073cb02970168cb82cfd2605.jpg" /></p>

<p>The nastiest part was chipping off all the mortar and such from the concrete slab. Need to get it pretty smooth for the subloor to sit properly on top of it. This is the part that took the most time and effort.</p>

<p><img alt="The remaining mortar needs chipped away." src="/assets/2020/01/01/chipping-away-8f79085caa775401c267de84b3d70fc53bce99aa707de9ba1b9eb85824683016.jpg" /></p>

<p>I doubt that I would have had the motivation to finish had he not said something along the lines of <em>“you’ll never get all that done tonight”</em>. Apparently the way to motivate me is to tell me I can’t do something. He left around 5pm, and I fed the cats and ate some dinner, then went back down to finish chipping the last bit away. Even put in another row of floor. Woot!</p>

<p>The whole thing was huge and pretty ugly, so I’m glad it’s on it’s way out. I wanna get the fireplace converted to gas, and maybe put in a wood beam mantle with space for the TV above it. Long term goals…</p>
