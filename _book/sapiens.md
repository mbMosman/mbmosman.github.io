Wow... This was way more than I expected. I was expecting a rather dry history of man, and got a very engaging and thought provoking read. 

I understand this has been well received by general audiences, and not so well received by the more scholarly audience. I can totally see how that might happen. This is written to be accessible to everyone, not written as some unapproachable historical text that you can barely stand to read unless you've got some super degree and background in history. I suspect that short of the thought provoking opinions on human happiness interjected into this, there isn't "new" scholarly history here, which is fine. Seems to me he's just made everyone else's historical studies accessible to general audiences, and that's important to. 

This is an awesome book. I highly recommend it to anyone with any sense of curiosity on human history, where we come from and where we might go from here.
