	This volume (and the corresponding part of the anime) intrigues me, as it would be really easy to just ignore Su-Won and paint him as evil. But that isn't happening and it's interesting to see Yona's mixed feelings about it, and it makes me really wonder where things will end up in the end. The end of the volume though is one of my favorite Hak & Yona scenes. <3
