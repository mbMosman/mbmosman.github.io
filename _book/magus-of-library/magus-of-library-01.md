> In the small village of Amun lives a poor boy named Theo. Theo adores books, but because of his pointed ears and impoverished life, he isn’t allowed to use the village library. As he endures the prejudice and hatred of the village, he dreams of going where such things don’t exist: Aftzaak, City of Books. But one day, Theo chances to meet a Kafna — a librarian who works for the great library of Aftzaak—and his life changes forever...

This was awesome!  What else would one expect from a fan of books regarding a story about the power of books, right? I will say this clearly hits many favorite spots for me... Still, it is a really awesome story with interesting characters and amazingly detailed and beautiful art. There are so many great messages tucked inside, some more obvious than others. 

Looking forward to reading more!
