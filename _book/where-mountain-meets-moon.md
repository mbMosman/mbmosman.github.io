What an awesome story. It made me so very happy to read. I could read it again and again. I managed to read through this in a (rather late) night, mostly because I just couldn't stop and put it down. However if one's intent were to read it to kids, or let them read it themselves, it's nicely broken up into short sections and mini-stories within the larger story itself. There are nice picture scattered throughout (though it's not a picture book) and the story is just magical. 

Loved it so much I finished the borrowed library book and bought a copy to send to my nieces as well as one to keep for myself. ^.^
