I was talking about how August hasn't been super upliftng for me, and well this book kinda fits that theme. It's a rather introspective tale in some ways, but while a tale of a goddess, it isn't a tale of a glorious and wonderful life... or is it? 

Circe is a child of the Titan Helios, but she's not the shining beauty her sisters are. They tell her that her chin is too sharp and her voice like a crow. She *grows up* feeling helpless and inferior, and bullied by her siblings and their friends.  She finds herself in love with a mortal but she can't be with a mortal, so she spells him into a god only to have him reject her. She learns to expect the worst, and genenerally has those expectations met. When she dares to hope, things fall to pieces around her. 

Yet somehow I don't find it a sad tale... I think that is because Circe never really seems unhappy herself. While she does find her moments of happiness, they are always fleeting, but she's accepting of that. She seems able to treasure those happy moments and memories while still understanding they can't last. She is content and accepting of who she is and while she occassionally challenges her place in the world, but she isn't surprised when things don't work out in her favor or when they do so in hidden ways. She finds a way to make her own path and mark, and that feels real, not sad. 

I didn't love this right away. It didn't grab me in the same way that The Song of Achilles did, but before the half-way point, I was hooked and it became hard to put down. Maybe it is because Circe is a little too relatable a character. Despite being a goddess, she's got a hard life, and there isn't much she can do to change it. That makes it *real* and a little less escapist for me, and right now a little escape wouldn't have been so bad.
