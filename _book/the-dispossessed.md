I feel like this book really fullfilled on it's premise rather late in the book, somewhere around the last 3-4 chapters. Before that, it was a little rough following everything through the interwoven timeframes, and feeling a sense of direction in the story. Characters come and go and pop up again, and sometimes it was hard to remember who they were and what their significance was. Fortunately, in some cases the author gives very clear reminders, in others they weren't super important anyway. The end (even though it leaves a lot open) really brings it all together and makes the journey all worthwhile.
