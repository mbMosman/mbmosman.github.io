Well, I'm not going to say that the cleaning/sweeping part is any less strange, but I really like where the story has gone. It kinda sorta moves the cheesy to something that aims to be a little more thoughtful (the cleanliness of the space around you reflects your mental well-being?).  Well, and there's an owl... I'm a sucker for owls...
