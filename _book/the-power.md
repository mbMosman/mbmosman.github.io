I thought the book was really well done. It hits social issues that are super relevant today, and while it highlights a lot that is *wrong* in the world, it's not *preachy* about a particular opinion. There are some *types* of people that it doesn't paint in a very nice light, but honestly I'm not sure anyone in the book is painted in a *nice light*... On some level that keeps things "real", but it really does make this a tough, depressing read.

The writing is good, the plot is well structured, the characters feel fairly real. I don't particularly like the "wrapper" story put around the actual story, but I get it and it's a pretty trivial bit overall. I think it would have been fine without it. However it does give the author a chance to poke a few extra jabs.

I don't like the implication that women need some fancy evolutionary power-shifting mechanism to alter the world's balance of power between the sexes. I don't think it will be an easy thing to shift, but I don't like the implication that the source of the problem is physical power. I don't think it's ever been about physical power. I feel like this trivializes the problem which is far more social/cultural influence than physical power.

The problem here for me is that it triggers all this social issue stuff in my head, so I can't just find myself enjoying the book as fiction. Yet I feel like it misses the mark on the social issues in so very many ways. In this world, suddenly men are feeling like they could be victims of physical/sexual violence, but that's only a small part of the issue. As the story moves more toward the end where men are becoming questionably needed property, and one takes into consideration the wrapper in which the man writing this scholarly work is encouraged to publish under a woman's name, then we start to see some of those larger surrounding issues brought into the picture. However I feel like that treatment trivializes the larger issues and attitudes that leads to the physical violence.

As a story, it is far from uplifting, but it is a good story. If you want to think deeper about the larger issue of male/female power balance, I just don't feel like it helps with that conversation.
