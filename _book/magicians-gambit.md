This wasn't the most exciting part of the story, but it sounds like the extent of the required party for prophecy fulfillment is complete. I do like that despite fulfilling a prophecy, there's room for things to shape up in a serveral different ways so the story isn't entirely predictable. 

There's been a lot of character development, and we've learned more about the earlier party plus picked up a few more characters. I'm most curious where things will go with Relg, who seems quite irritating yet has so much room for growth and change. I'm interested to see if the *innocent* with the orb will be the child he seeks or if he'll get over his women thing and father the child.
