This took me *forever* to actual get around to reading, and I also ended up taking my time getting through it. However I was still totally able to lose myself in here for a good chunk of time and enjoy every single moment of it. I was a little miffed by all the *Brin*ness in the end, but it truly did all fit nicely together and felt like a really, really solid and well told story. I did not love, or even like a lot of the choices that many of the characters made, but honestly that helped to *make* the story as a whole for me. Sometimes I don't *want* to get what I *want* if that makes any sense at all.
