OK, so one more volume of this and I think I'm hitting my limits. This volume finds us on a cruise ship with mysterious missing persons & death / not deaths.  I guess they are dead but not showing up in the underworld? Well whatever, our duo of Tsuzuki and Hisoka are sent to investigate. There they run into their nemisis Dr. Muraki, who I might have remembered from Volume 1 if I had been able to read it. Hisoka has a very strong negative reaction to seeing him, while Tsuzuki is more just flirted with. Anyhow, he's taking care of Tsubaki, the daughter of the CEO of the company running the cruise line. She has a weak heart, and he did a transplant for her. Surely that has no connection to the missing persons...

Anyhow there's a series of murders on board and our duo is caught between investigation of the murders and the missing people. Are they connected or not? I found that I wasn't really into this mystery, crime fighing storyline, and Tsubaki and Hisoka aren't really doing it for me either. There seems to be some back story of abuse between Hisoka and Dr. Muraki and Tsuzuki is trying to be there for him as he heals. 

I finished this up a bit disappointed, and I'm not sure that I'll read the next even though it is sitting right here waiting.
