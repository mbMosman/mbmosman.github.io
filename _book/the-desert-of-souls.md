This was a good example of being able to judge a book by its cover...  It was a good solid read, but it's not high brow literature. I though the characters were well done, the writing solid, and the setting was great for adventure. There were a few surprises, but you're rarely in doubt as to how things will turn out in the end. Overall, an enjoyable afternoon read.
