Well this is a blast from the past for sure. It has an old school dungeon & dragon feel to it that, at least if you're into that sort of thing, doesn't disappoint. There's definitely adventure, and lots of it. While I feel we're led through plot point by plot point, with occasional mysteries - very clearly laid out - for a younger audience, I don't think that's so bad. 

The characters feel a bit dated, but well, the book is from the 80's. I think we expect a bit more depth in our characters today, but honestly while I'd usually be tempted to say these heroes are a little flat, I don't feel too let down by this. This is more a story to read for the plot and *story*, more so than the characters. Though I will say for those that read this back in the day the characters are still pretty fresh in the memory, or at least that's true of the people I've talked to. I can see why too, they might feel template or cliche now, but these folks laid down that template. They're among the originals. They're bad characters either. I think my only disappointment is just that you don't get put in their head so much to know what's going on behind the scenes, and I'd love to get a little more inside some of those heads. 

Overall, while it was a really enjoyable read which I thought held up a lot better than some other first reads and re-reads of books from that era. While this is not what I've become used to, it was perhaps a refreshing read for that reason alone. I'm really starting to feel like every time I open a book, I already know what's going to happen and that's no fun.
