> With the help of a magical pair of sneakers, a young sorceress transforms into an adult and sets out on magical adventures full of wonder and danger! Ran Uruma can’t wait to grow up and become a sorceress like her mother, so with the help of a magical pair of sneakers, she transforms into an adult and sets off! Her father and older brother Jin try to keep her home safe, but Ran is determined to advance her powers and have adventures of her own!

This came to my attention in looking for some short manga series to recommend to someone who's not read any manga before. It sounded rather entertaining, so I though I'd give it a go too. So far, I'm glad I did. It was pretty entertaining and cute, though I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of some adult guy hitting on a kid, even if she has been magically transformed into a grown up. However I must say, I think the author does a great job of channeling a kid's spirit into each page. It's magical.
