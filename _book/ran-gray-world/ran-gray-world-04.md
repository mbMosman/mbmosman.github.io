I'm mixed overall on this volume, the story pulls back some of the things that happened earlier w/ Otaro, but because of the sideline off into things at Ran's school it feels abrubt disjointed and kinda unwanted. The events surrounding Ran at school are so much more interesting. 

I suppose that *bad* things don't necessarily happen when you want, but it feels like this plot could have evolved better, smoother. I can't imagine having read it serialized, chapter by chapter. It was hard enough to follow what was going on with Otaro reading it all in one sitting. 

There's more fan service in this volume as well, so it makes me a lot more self-conscious to read this over lunch or on a full bus. That's a good bit of my available reading time. Heaven forbid someone asks me what it's about... 

The art is great, and the characters are really quirky and interesting. I can't help but like it, and brush aside all the things that would annoy me if I thought much about them.
