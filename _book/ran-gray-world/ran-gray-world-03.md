OK, so things got more than a bit uncomfy in this volume as Otaro is definitely crossing lines here w/ Ran, though it's just all weird given the magic situation. It's not like Ran isn't putting herself into bad situations, but she's a kid and just doesn't get it. Otaro however doesn't really know that, though his behavior isn't great regardless, but to make the situation more complex, he's dreaming and aware of that... Can you hold someone accountable for behavior in a dream? Anyhow, there's no denying that he's quite a bit of a jerk, especially as he kisses Sango just because he knows she's with Jin (Ran's brother). 

Jin's equally out of control in this volume, as his wolf nature has him "in heat" (I get the idea, but on that's a female hormonal thing... science people! Though who needs science in a world of magic.) Anyhow this has him kissing all the girls in school, until he kisses Sango who he runs off with and we next see them waking up naked in bed. 

So anyhow, I keep telling myself that fiction doesn't always have to be *moral*, and if it's an enjoyable read, read it. Despite that however, I find this pushes my cringe buttons quite a bit. I'm intrigued enough to continue and see where this bug posession/war plotline is going, but be forewarned that there's a good bit of busty woman, nudity, and socially questionable behavior mixed into this story.
