Wow... I was really impressed by this book. This is my first dive into Sullivan's writing and his world of Elan. I was immediately sucked in and it never really slowed down. The writing is well done, the characters solid, and the story feels complete and well planned out. It also hits all my favorite themes: mystery & magic, clever & loyal animal companions, gods & myth, people rising above to fight for those they love.

It’s been a while since I’ve been this impressed with a book and even longer since I’ve been this impressed with a book that’s part of a series. Even better, I don’t have to wait years to read my fill!!!  Looking forward to the next.
