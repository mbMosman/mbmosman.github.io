It's been a long while since I've spent a day reading a book. I haven't the focus for it this year, but as I expected from other reviews, this totally pulled me in and I had a lovely morning and afternoon reading through it. I'm not sure how I feel about the preview into the next book, but I'm kinda tempted. I rather enjoyed the characters here and spending a little more time with them might be nice.
