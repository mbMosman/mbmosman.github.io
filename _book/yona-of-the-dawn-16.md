Oh my, the story definitely takes a turn for the more intense here, both within this volume and with what promises to come next. As one might have expected, Hak and Su-won come face to face for the first time since the night he murdered the king and took the crown. Riri continues to follow in Yona's footsteps, standing up for her people against the drug lord Hyo with the help of her body guard who seems awfully independently minded for hired help. We know he's Su-won, but she hadn't figured that out yet. Things are resolved in the Water Tribe lands, and this story arc ends as everyone heads off.
