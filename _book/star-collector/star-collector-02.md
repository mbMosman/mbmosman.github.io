At a few points I was somewhat optimistic that we might see a little more interesting character development in this volume. We get to see some contrast between Flynn's relatively nice family life and Niko's more disfunctional one. We also learn that his grandfather, who raised him, is in a nursing home due to Alzheimer's, and that is deeply affecting him. However, this is all really just setup for the two to hook up again. Maybe these issues will be explored later, but this is all just too shallow for me to want to continue. It gets rather explicit as well, which I didn't expect, and don't really appreciate. I've got an imagination, let me use it.

If you're looking for a story that's nothing more than a setup for the main couple to get it on, then this might suite your fancy, but this is the end of the series for me.
