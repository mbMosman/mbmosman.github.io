A friend brought back a Tokyopop 2019 manga pamphlet back for me from Comicon and I thought I'd give some of these newer manga a try. This was on the first page spread, in a section labeled "International Women of Manga". I haven't read any German manga, and in fact wasn't really even aware of those following the tradition outside of Japan. I like astronomy too, so while the boy-love isn't something I hunt out, I figured I'd give it a go.

Personally I was a little disappointed. I expected a bit of a deeper story with more building of character. It isn't that the characters are totally flat or uninteresting, but everything just falls into place, in no time at all for the Flynn & Niko hook up. There's no depth to the relationship, it's painted as one, yet the two really know nothing about each other while their sharing a bed before the end of the volume.
