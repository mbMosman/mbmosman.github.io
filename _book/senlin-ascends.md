Cool story. I really enjoyed the single character perspective. We get the entire story from Senlin's, imperfect & limited, perspective. It was nice not to be hopping around character to character. 

I *really* liked this up until the point that I realized the story wasn't going to end in one volume. I'd really like to know how things turn out when/if Senlin finds his wife, but I'm not sure I have it in me to read multiple volumes to find out. I'm also not sure the story itself can sustain this adventure that long...

I'll give the next one a go, but I've got higher priorities and I've already resolved myself it is fine if I decide not to finish it.
