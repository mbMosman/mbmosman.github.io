I picked this up mainly for the quiz to sort out your enneagram type. However, by the time I got the book, I had already sorted out my type from a different book. However it was still nice to get a sort of confirmation that I was right. The test & scoring takes about an hour and is pretty straight forward. There's a short summary of each type following the test, which is perfect for making sure the results are correct. It's solid for a starting spot, but if you're into it, you'll probably want something more to help you understand your type better and get a sense for how to use that knowledge to help you grow.
