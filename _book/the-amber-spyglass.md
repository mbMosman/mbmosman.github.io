Well, I finished it...  This isn't a series I would revisit. I honestly found this last book particularly hard to make it through, it was just kinda boring. I didn't feel very drawn in to the world(s) and while things seemed complicated, I never really felt much depth. I find it hard to put my finger on exactly what I think was missing, but I feel like this is a story I should have loved but didn't. It was OK at best, and that's looking across the whole of the trilogy more so than this last volume itself. This one just felt too plodding and padded. Much of the side adventures & characters just really didn't seem to matter. The ending was touching in some ways, but also felt a bit shallow. There was a unique and interesting idea here, but in the end it just didn't impress me.
