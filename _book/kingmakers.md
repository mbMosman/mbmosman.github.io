	This was a good finish to the story, but there were a few disappointing bits to it. I expected a bit more from Fray, but she kinda got played as nothing more than a spying, jealous fool in the end. Don't get me wrong, that had to come, but the way it played out could have been handled better. She was built up to be more than they delivered on in the end. Likewise Cesare got to show his stuff a bit more in the end, but it also felt a little too late. The last bit of death in Gareth's keep was also pretty unnecessary and doesn't take into account well the nature of cats. I could continue being nitpicky, but I should really just take it for what it was, a good, enjoyable light read.
