As I've learned to expect this latest volume delivers nicely on the promise of interest and intrigue. It's interesting to watch what everyone is expecting to be the end of the series approach, as we get nearer to the Meji Restoration. I'm still extremely impressed by the series as a whole, and looking forward to the next volume.
