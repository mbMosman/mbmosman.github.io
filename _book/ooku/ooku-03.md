This volume continues the story of Iemitsu and Arikoto, but we also get Lady Kasuga's story too. This volume really makes clear that it is not just reimagining a different history for Japan in which women rule instead of men, but one in which the same (or a very similar) history is happening with different people behind the scenes. It's pretty neat actually, but again I appreciate the historical notes to help clarify what I don't know (which is a heck of a lot) about Japanese history, language, and culture.

The story is really well told, and the art style is well suited to it. I'm appreciating all of this a lot more now that I've gotten past my initial skepticism, as well as the language, and have been able to settle into the mood of things more.

With the change in scene from the 1st volume to the 2nd, I didn't get too invested in sorting out who was who in the 2nd volume, figuring it would just change again. It didn't really, well some characters are new, but overall they are the same. I think I'd appreciate a more attentive re-read, but time is limited and I really want to move on to the next volume.
