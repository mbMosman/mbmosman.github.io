This volume continues with the story of Iemitsu's daughter, Ietsuna and then her successor Tsunayosi. We get to see the passing of the senior chamberlain from Arikoto to a new upstart who managed to sneak in unexpectedly. Clever and interesting twist... 

It's interesting to see the story continue across generations, and to see the societal changes as the pox continues to linger. It's interesting that it's not really a role-reversal between men and women, it's more women doing everything while men are kept as pampered prizes. The work women did, they still do, plus the work the men did as well. An interesting twist indeed...
