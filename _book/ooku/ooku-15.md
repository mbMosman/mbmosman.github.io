We see the end of Iesada's time as shogun and the end of her happy dream.  Her consort Taneatsu sticks around to advise the next young shogun Iemochi. Things end with the arrival of her new consort, the Prince Kuzu who has ties to the Emperor. Turns out however that the *prince* is not what anyone expects. How will Takiyama handle this?
