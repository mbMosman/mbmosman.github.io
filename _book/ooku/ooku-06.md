This volume sees the end of Tsunayoshi, and welcomes in the reign of Ienobu. This seems but a small interlude, as it's hinted that Ienobu is unwell, but the new concubine Sakyo is quite an interesting figure too. It's great that the two of them can find some common ground and make the best of their lot in life. Akifusa as well seems quite the loyal lady, wily and scheming too it seems.
