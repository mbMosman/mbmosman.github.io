It's been a while since I read the first 4, but the nice thing here is that it isn't hard to pick these back up as the cast of characters changes rather frequently, while the setting itself remains the same. I think that this set has been my favorite so far. Emonnosuke, Akimoto, Gyokuei, and of course Tsunayoshi, are all mischievous and fascinating in their own ways. And then of course I'm quite curious about the young lady we meet at the end, O-Nobu soon to be Yoshimune.
