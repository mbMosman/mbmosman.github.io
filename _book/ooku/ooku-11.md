Another great volume of the story, they do feel like they are getting much weightier in each volume. This one sees the continuation of the Kuroki's work (one of Aounuma's followers) outside the inner chambers, as well as the beginning of Harusada's reign with her son Ienari as a puppet Shogun. Harusada seems to be quite the devil.
