Yoshimune officially declares her older daughter Ieshige, who has health issues that hinder her bodily control yet has a sound mind, as her heir much to the dismay of the court and lovely younger daughter Munetake. 

We also see the end of Yoshimune's reign, and as she reflects with with her retainer, we see her learn how she got there. Something I suspected all along, and wonder if she did as well...

In the end, we meet a half Dutch, half Japanese doctor who almost dies of the red-face pox, but does not! He agrees to go back to the capital to help aid research to find a cure.
