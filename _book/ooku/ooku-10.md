This was a heavy volume in so many ways! I can usually whip through a volume of manga on my bus commute, but this one took me 3 trips plus a little extra time over breakfast to finish. 

The cure to the redface pox is on it's way in the form of a vaccine, but will it survive the change in regime following the death of both the shogun and her daughter, as well as senior counselor Tanuma and her daughter. I was really sad to see the end of Gennai and Aonuma too. Hopefully the research and work on ending the pox will continue through the students. The next shogun is to be a boy, who's been innoculated against the redface pox, so not only is the regime changing, but so might the face of power.
