This volume see's the passing of Ieshige, and the start of her daughter Ieharu's reign. However there is still family trouble brewing over who should be the next in line for the shogunate. Yoshimune's other granddaughters are both plotting against the current regime, and one is a pretty big bottle of darkness. 

We also see the story of Aonuma, the half Dutch, half Japanese doctor, continues in the inner chambers. After a rough start, things pick up and more and more of the men begin to come for his lectures on Dutch medicine. With the help of Gennai (a woman posing as a man), it seems a solution for the red-faced pox is on the horizon. However the situation is precarious as trouble is brewing for Gennai and Okitsuga, the sponsors of Aonuma as well as the shogun herself. 

Overall, this series has far exceeded my expectations. While it's really hard to keep track of who is who from volume to volume, I appreciate that the characters change frequently, as it keeps me from latching on too much to the characters. Instead I can focus more on the larger picture and bits of history.
