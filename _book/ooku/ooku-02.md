This volume takes us back in time to explain how things got to the state they were in the first volume. We hop back to the beginning of the Redface Pox which was killing off all the young men and learn of the passing of the last male shogun with no male heir, only a daughter... It's a pretty interesting story, mixing well the tales of individual characters with the larger setting of politics and history. There's also historical & translation notes at the end that help a lot. 

I won't spoil the story itself, but I will leave two warnings...  1) There's a dead (murdered) cat. 2) There's rape, both of a woman & a boy.
