We see the Iesada find a little bit of happiness in her new consort. Takiyama finds this new consort to be quite different from what he expected. Masahiro wrangles politics around the trade agreement with the Americans, until she is forced into retirement due to illness. Still it's nice to see a little happiness for the shogun Iesada.
