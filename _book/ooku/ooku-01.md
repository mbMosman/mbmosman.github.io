> In Edo period Japan, a strange new disease called the Red Pox has begun to prey on the country's men. Within eighty years of the first outbreak, the male population has fallen by seventy-five percent. Women have taken on all the roles traditionally granted to men, even that of the Shogun. The men, precious providers of life, are carefully protected. And the most beautiful of the men are sent to serve in the Shogun's Inner Chamber...

I came across this a while ago browsing the manga shelves at the library but after seeing the "parental advisory explicit content" was a little put off assuming the worst of that label with this subject matter of a lady shogun and "inner chambers" populated only with lovely men... 

So, a year later I miss a bus and am stuck at the library again for 45 minutes with nothing in mind to borrow and I'm poking my way through the manga shelves again, but have now already read much of what is there and interesting to me when I come across this again.  I do a quick flip through and find isn't just full of sex and decide to go for it, bummer however they've now lost volume 1 from this location. So I put the e-book version on hold and leave with the next 3 volumes and wait. A few days later and I'm trying to read the e-book on the phone. I don't recommend that, but I was pleased with the story and art. This was a very interesting read... 

It took a little getting used to as the language is super formal with thee/thou and 'tis, and all that, but the idea is actually much more interestingly explored than I imagined. A disease strikes young men and lasts long enough to change society drastically. I initially assumed that was just a setup for romance, but I'd say it falls more as historical fiction than romance. I didn't bump into anything I though particularly worthy of the "parental advisory"... There is certainly more explicit content in today's average YA book than I found in here. I'm glad I picked up the next few volumes as I can't wait to get started reading them.
