This was an interesting book. It felt very *old-school* to me, though I don't mean that to be a negative thing. It had a nice breadth of history, philosophy, politics, adventure, and religion/magic. The main story follows a set of characters across multiple lives over some hundreds of years. Intermixed in there is a bit of magic, "wild folk" and elves. 

I suppose I would call Jill our main character and heroine of the story, and though I didn't always like her character, I feel like she was very true to herself (and her character) throughout. I found it a little hard at times to keep track of some of the more minor characters through their multiple lives, but it was nice that it didn't hop back and forth too much. The main timeline remains the focus with two *flashback* stories that happen more as a whole, rather than being interspersed chapter by chapter. There's a cheatsheet at the end that carries each character through, and while I missed catching the more minor characters in some places, I didn't feel that it really took anything away from the story either.

This starts a series, and I'm not sure that I'm enamored enough with it to grab the next book. However I did enjoy this story for what it was all on its own. It was a nice change of pace from some of my other recent reads and was well done.
