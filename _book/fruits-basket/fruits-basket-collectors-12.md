I love the ending to this story. It's an amazing work of art. I'm sure it isn't flawless, and it I dug around enough I sure I could find something to complain about. However, in the Fruits Basket spirit, I won't. I won't look for the bad, and instead will focus on all its amazing and wonderful qualities. I can't believe someone could read this and not come away from it unchanged in some way. 

The collector's edition is super cool too. I love the little extras included in this volume after the story wraps up. It's nice to see it packaged up so well. This fan is more than satisfied.
