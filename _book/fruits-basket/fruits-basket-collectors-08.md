We take a deep dive into Yuki's life in this volume, getting to see his childhood and his early encounter with Tohru & the story behind that baseball cap she's held on to all this time. There's an interlude with the Cinderella-ish class play, then we get a equally deep dive into what's been haunting Kyo. He also met Tohru's mom when he was little, and we get insight into Tohru's family through his memories of talking with Kyoko. 

As if that weren't enough, we also get a little Tohru meddling with Uo and Kurneo, and things are heating up with Akito and the zodiac crew. The story is long, and not always direct, but never has it been boring. However there's definitely build up here to and ending. Will it be happy for all? Will it be happy for anyone? So much could go oh so very wrong...
