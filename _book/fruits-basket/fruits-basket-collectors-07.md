Back in school and everyone is thinking about their futures, which makes it hard for Tohru knowing that Kyo doesn't have one. It's cool to get back story on many of the other characters here. We learn more about Yuki, Rin, Momiji and Hatsuharu. There's also more fun with Yuki and the student council crew.
