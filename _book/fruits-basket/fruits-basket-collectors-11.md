I think one of the things I appreciate about this story is that it isn't really about forgiveness so much as acceptance and understanding. Forgiveness seems more about the event, while acceptance of a person as they are - good and bad - is a lot more demanding. It's interesting to note that many of the things that make some of these characters more likeable and relatable from an audience perspective Tohru doesn't know. Much of that is visible to us through the interactions between other characters and characters self-reflection. But Tohru accepts them all regardless. I think that's really what makes it so amazing. 

Tohru doesn't ask or tell anyone to act differently or change. She might inspire them to want it or give them support to work at it, but she never demands it of anyone. She accepts them all as they are flawed in their own way, and finds something to cherish about each of them. What an amazing and powerful thing that is.
