We kick things off with Kureno, learning why he doesn't go to see Uo again, as well as learning more about him and the *curse* as well as Akito. The curse wouldn't be a called a curse if it were all fun, games, and cute animals, but things clearly have taken a darker turn over the recent chapters. That continues through this volume with darker moments interspersed with brighter, more hopeful ones. Things wrap up with hope for Rin & Haru, but Tohru is left facing the reality of Kyo's confinement if the curse isn't broken soon. 

I think that's what makes a crazy, fantastical story like this so *real*. Whose life is all gloom or all sunshine? There are moments of both mixed all up together.
