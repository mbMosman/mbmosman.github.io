We get Hana's backstory in this volume, and as with the others, she also has experienced her share of bullying and has reason to be withdrawn from others. My favorite part of this volume though is Uotani's new love. ^.^ Kureno is a new character, and we don't get to see much of him, but learn that he's kept close to Akito and away from the other's in the zodiac.
