This second volume gets us through Chapter 24, which is the 1 year anniversary of the death of Tohru's mother. We meet Hatsuharu (ox), Ayame (snake), and get a better peek at the mysterious Akito. Kagura & Momiji are back for a bit, and we learn a good bit more about some of the main characters, particulary Yuki. There's also more mystery opening up around Kyo. What was going on when Sigure got him all riled up, and what's going on between him and Hana at the gravesite? What's with the chaotic waves and guilt?

This volume has some great moments in it too. Momiji's story is pretty sad and touching, but the story about the foolish traveler was too perfect. The obligatory trip to the hot springs is fun, and Ayame's introduction serves well to lighten some of the heavier moments, as does Sigure's tormenting of his poor editor. It's a good mix of light humor and deeper, more serious moments. It's a bit middle of the story, but the author does a great job of slipping out just enough to keep the characters growing and the plotline moving along so the story doesn't feel like it has slowed down.
