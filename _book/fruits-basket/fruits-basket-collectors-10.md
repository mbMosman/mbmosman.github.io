There's a definite feel of urgency as graduation is approaching and the curse and Kyo's confinement are looming. Tohru is realizing her love for Kyo, but is conflicted over it as he's taking her mother's place as first in her heart. That feels like betrayal. Kyo is also fighting his own battle, recognizing his own feelings for her, but believing she could never return them. He's also battling with feelings of guilt and responsibility over his mom's suicide as well as the accident leading to Tohru's mom's death. With the curse breaking all around, what will become of these two?
