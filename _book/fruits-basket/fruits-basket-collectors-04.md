This fourth volume gets us through Chapter 48. It starts with the introduction of Hiro Sohma, the ram, who's quite a jerk to Tohru, bullying and manipulating her. However we also learn more of Akito's abusive nature as Sigure and Hatori discuss Hiro and Kisa's situation. We also learn that Rin, who we haven't met yet, was hospitalized after angering Akito. The question comes up as to whether or not Tohru will end up facing Akito's anger too. Next, we get Uotani's back story, which is pretty touching for the past of a former gang member. It's awesome at the end to see her mirroring her hero Kyoko's behavior toward some little middle school gang girls too. Yuki also steps up, channeling Tohru by supporting and inspiring Mokoto, the Yuki Fan Club president. When Hatsuharu cracks in class, we learn that his relationship with Rin is why Akito was angry and she ended up hospitalized. Now she's dumped him, and he doesn't understand why. We're almost through the zodiac as we meet Ritsu next. He is much like his mother, who we met earlier at the hot springs. He's got quite the complex, feeling completely worthless, constantly appologizing for his own existence. Tohru of course encourages him, and then he meets Micchan, Sigure's editor... will that be a good thing? Things wrap up with everyone excited for summer break.

We got hints of the darker aspects of being a zodiac Sohma in the last volume, and they continue here as well. Rin hints that Sigure is her only hope, making me wonder what exactly he is up to with Tohru. Hatori has implied that he's using her, and I assume it is to break the curse. Sigure is also starting to seem subtlely underhanded. He says that Akito will get what's coming in the end... Is he working for or against Akito? Perhaps the truth is more that he's looking out for himself.
