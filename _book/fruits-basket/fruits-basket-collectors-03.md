The third volume gets us through Chapter 36. There are a lot of great moments in this volume, including the trip to the lake house where Sigure is teasing Kyo about Jason the bear and we learn the after effects of Kana's wedding. We also find out that Tohru, Yuki & Kyo's teacher used once dated Sigure, but dumped him after a month. ^.^  We also get to meet Kisa Sohma, the tiger, and the Yuki Fan Club girls visit Hana's house looking for her weakness only to get "cursed" by her little brother. Tohru gets sick and Kyo cooks for her, and Kyo's master appears revealing the secret of his "other form". Kyo starts to try and change some of his bad behaviors, and not to be out done, Yuki does too, as he accepts becoming the student council president. The volume ends with Yuki and Tohru's visit to Ayame's very interesting shop.

The story starts to hit on some deeper, darker issues here, though it hasn't always been sunshine and flowers. We've gotten hints that Yuki's life wasn't so great before "running away" to Shigure's place. We knew Kyo was an outcast, but now we see he's got a *real* dark side. We also see the effects of school bullying with Kisa's story as well, and that echos the bullying that popped up previously in Tohru's past as well. Tohru's ability to unconditionally love is the ray of sunshine through the clouds that manages to keep the story feeling good despite all the hardship and pain.
