Summer vacation is in full swing and they are all off to stay at one of the Sohma vacation homes. However when Akito shows up, he is determined to keep the others away from her. He calls the others over to him each day, leaving Tohru and Kyo (since he's excluded from the zodiac) alone together. When he realizes they are happy together, he calls on Kyo to come too, reminding him that he will be locked away after graduation from high school. That's OK, Tohru hears of this too and is more determined than ever to break the curse and save Kyo from that fate. 

This feels like a pretty big turning point in the story! Excited for what's next!
