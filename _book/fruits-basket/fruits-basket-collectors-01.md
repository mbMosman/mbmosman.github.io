I'm super excited to be reading this again! I read these earlier from the Japanese manga with scanned translations, and meant to come back to it now that they've been published in English, but just never did. The manga is significantly longer than one might expect from the original anime series, which is how I was introduced to it, so it would have been quite the investment, and having already read them... well I was being cheap. Especially since this has been on of my absolute favorite series ever since. I want a poster for "Everything important I learned from Fruits Basket". For now, this is the best I could find [7 Lessons I Learned From "Fruits Basket"](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rice-ball-in-fruits-basket). It's actually a pretty good list, but maybe as I read through this again, I'll make my own.

It's also cool to be re-reading this as the [new anime series](/vizmedia/fruits-basket-2019.html) is coming out. Since I'm watching it with Christy, I can't just dive in every week, so this will help fill me up in between her weekends in MN.
