Well I adored Wil Weaton, and thought he was a pretty awesome writer from reading his blog, long before finally getting around to reading this book. So it’s not like the slate was clean going in. But that also means I had high expectations going in, and I was not disappointed at all.

I find it interesting that Wil can say things that had it come from someone else, it would probably put me off, joke or not, yet from him is somehow OK. I don’t think thats just a free pass because of who he is. I think it is because his writing is so personal and open that there isn’t any vagueness in his actual meaning or intention. Where many celebrities have a mask or public persona, here we get the real deal, with all the self doubt, personal struggle, and genuine joy that makes him so relatable and awesome.

It’s been many years now since I visited his blog, but after finishing up the book yesterday I had to go check it out and see if it was as I remembered.  It was and I’ll have to be sure to visit more often. You too should check it out if you haven't: http://wilwheaton.net/
