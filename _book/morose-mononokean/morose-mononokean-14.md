> Before anyone asks, how I read this before it was published, [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are individually realeased.

Things are getting super interesting now... not that they weren't before, but the trouble in the underworld is heating up and so are questions around Abeno, Ashiya, his mother & Sakae. There are so many questions in play at the moment it's hard to keep what I know, what I think I know, what I suspect but am not sure of, and what I don't know at all straight! I never suspected from the fairly happy-go-lucky stories in the beginning that we would get here.
