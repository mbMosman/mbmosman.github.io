> FYI - I read this from [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) who simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are realeased.

So excited to see how everything will play out. What is this mysterious lingering connection between Hanae and Sakae, and of course is Aoi still alive?
