> FYI - I read this from [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) who simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are realeased.

OMG!!! Talk about a clif-hanger ending! The search for Aoi continues throughout this volume, then at the end... 

Damn! I totally appreciate the shaping of the story here. Great job chapter to chapter and volume to volume. I am always looking forward to my little doses of this throughout the year.
