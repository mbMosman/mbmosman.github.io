> Before anyone asks, how I read this before it was published, [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are individually realeased.

I'm really liking the way the story is going. I'm on the edge of my seat to learn more about the characters & their past and what deeper connection might be lurking...
