The volumes aren't yet licensed & published in English, but the series can read digitally from [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) with a subscription. 

I can't seem to get enough of these characters and am dying to know more of the story behind the Mononkean and its master. The setup for the story is great, and there is good depth to the story as well. Fuzzy is so cute!!!
