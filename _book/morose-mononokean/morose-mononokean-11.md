> Before anyone asks, how I read this before it was published, [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are individually realeased.

Things are starting to get deeper and more intense in this volume. There have been hints that there's more to Hanae than one might think, but where will it all lead and will we learn of Abeno's past?
