> Before anyone asks, how I read this before it was published, [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are individually realeased. 

I'm really curious about Abeno and Ashiya, and what the whole story is with Aoi & Sakae... I've enjoyed the playing out of the mystery as it deepens, but I'm starting to get a little impatient and confused too. Still, I feel like it is fair and to some extent we as the audience are in Ashiya's shoes, learning little bits as we're along for the ride.
