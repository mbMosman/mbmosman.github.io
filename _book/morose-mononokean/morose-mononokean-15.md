> FYI - I read this from [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/comics/manga/the-morose-mononokean/volumes) who simulpubs the manga chapter by chapter as they are realeased.

It was great to get a little more insight into the underworld Princess and Yahiko. More importantly finally getting the details on Abeno & Aoi... As the search for Aoi goes on, I'm on the edge of my seat to know what happens next.

I really love this story... I have so many thoughts on where things are going but just don't know and I love it! I'm so excited for each new little bit of the story, and am never let down.
