I miss books like this. Short and sweet, and oh so well put together. The thought put into word choice and phrasing is sadly lacking from so much that I read of late. The tales of Azhrarn, Prince of Demons & Night's Master, are so well crafted, flowing naturally from one to the next but coming so perfectly, full circle back to the beginning. It was beautiful.
