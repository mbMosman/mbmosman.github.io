So I caught this on some scanlation more than a year ago, and have been somewhat patiently waiting for the published volumes to catch up to this arc of the story. I think there was a bit more before I had read before Viz picked this up for NA and the scanlation stopped, but this volume ended with the last thing I remember, and I feel like I've been waiting for the next step forever!!! I can hardly bear the suspense any longer. 

I love this story. I adore these characters. I just wish Viz would catch us up on it a little faster. Of course the flip side of that is that it's motivation to learn Japanese...
