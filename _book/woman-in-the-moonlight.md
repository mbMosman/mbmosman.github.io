I picked this up as a Kindle First freebie. It's not my general sort of book, but it was around and I was short some books to finish up my goal for the year. So, forgive me for not being super excited about it.

That said though, it was a pretty decent book. It's not one I likely will remember much later on, but it was an enjoyable story. I appreciated the effort put into the story and historical research. It blended facts, fiction and music nicely. It wouldn't have been my first pick but it was a good read.
