Some resolution here and a dramatic turn! (which I won't spoil)

Sad, but also somewhat glad to know the story will wrap up in the next volume. I really like the characters, but the story overall feels a little directionless. I'm reading it for the characters & relationships, but that can only go on for so long without more plot drama.
