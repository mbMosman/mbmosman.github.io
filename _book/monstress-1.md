I'm not sure how I discovered this, but oh I am so very glad that I did! It's managed to win a good number of awards and accolades and I can see why. It's dark, and it's not going to be for everyone, but I think it's worth a try.

It's pretty awesome in all regards - the art, the story, the characters, and oh the cats! A snippet from the back said something along the lines of "the best cats in comics" and I'm inclined to agree, though I'm not a cats in comics connoisseur or anything either.
