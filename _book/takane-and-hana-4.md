	Well, this wasn't the most exciting volume, but it was still a relaxing read. I felt a bit like the humor and antagonism between them was falling a little flat as they try to sort things out, or maybe it is just getting a little old. Still looking for the next, but something will have to happen soon to keep things interesting.
