Summary: 

> In a land far away, there were two kingdoms: the Outside, where twisted beasts roamed that could curse with a touch, and the Inside, where humans lived in safety and peace. The girl and the beast should never have met, but when they do, a quiet fairytale begins. 

This popped up as a recommendation as something those who like the Ancient Magus Bride might like. Seems like a reasonable connection. Here the girl seems younger, but still she has a sort of guardian *other* looking after her.

The art is dark, but has a sense of sweetness to it. It is beautifully drawn. One volume in, the story itself is both sweet and dark as well. I'm already curious what else Nagabe has done.
