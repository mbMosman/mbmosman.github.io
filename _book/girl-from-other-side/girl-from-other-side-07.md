Things are getting pretty intense here, we left off with the pair feeling from the soldiers, yet at least Teacher seemed to realize it would only be a matter of time before they were found again. Now the two most troublesome have found them and while Teacher sets out on his own and is discovered by one, the other is after Shiva...

The story continues to be fairly dark, both in the art style and the story itself. The art is pretty much black & white, and while beautiful and fitting, I sometimes struggle to tell the difference between say fire and snow, which is mildly annoying. Still it's a great story and I'm looking forward to the next volume.
