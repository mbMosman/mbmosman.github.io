I wasn't sure what to make of this...

I had warm fuzzies just opening it up. Fruits Basket is probably hands down my favorite manga and anime (in that order). It's so sweet and always lifts me up when I'm feeling down. It's my go to cheer up. 

That feel is here too. BUT...

It's different. I get that, there are Sohmas that aren't the Sohmas that I know. I want to try and tie them back to Sohmas I know, but while there may be some hints there's no directly overt links made. Maybe that's good... but if nothing else hunting for them was distracting. 

Then there are just so many characters introduced right away with so little to hold onto to remember who they are or why they might be important. It was overwhelming, and maybe that is intentional. Perhaps that's how Sawa is feeling and we are meant to feel it too. I definitely felt in over my head and a little lost and confused. 

Maybe that's OK... I'm not going to jump ship yet. It was cute. Sawa, Hajime, & Mutsuki are cute and endearing in their own ways. But it wasn't the FB I remember, which is as it should be after all it's a new title. But it made me want it to be more of the same with the name and the hints at what came before. I want to know what became of Tohru & Kyo & Yuki & all the Sohmas of the past. Maybe we will find out, just not yet.
