OK, so if volume 1 was a little hard to understand, this magnifies things a bit. There's __*a lot*__ of historical reference here that I knew just enough to grasp but not enough to truly understand. The end notes were super helpful with this, but clearly can only begin to fill in the missing pieces. Still, the story itself doesn't really require you to fully understand the historical characters these are based on to appreciate that it's setting up for battle.
