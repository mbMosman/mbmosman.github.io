This was suggested to me when I was asking around for short manga series (7-8 volumes or less) to recommend to a friend who hasn't read any manga because they all seem to be super long series. 

This is a 4 volume series, but what I know now (but wasn't told by the one recommending it) is that it is short because it has been indefinitely put on hiatus. __There is no end and it drops off quite suddenly with zero resolution at volume 4.__ Just wanna get that out there up front before someone else picks it up only to be equally disappointed. 

OK, so that out there, I loved this. First off I really love the art style. It's just beautiful. I also really like the the mix of history and fantasy. The main character is a fan of Kyoto history & culture, so I learned a bit about Kyoto in reading (mostly the end notes). That's pretty cool! The end notes are super helpful with the details an average foreigner isn't going to know, but it can feel a little overwhelming to pick all this up at the end. (I never read end notes until the end as I worry about spoilers.) 

The first volume is a little tough to get into as there is a lot going on with very little explanation. It definitely hops right in without a lot of setup. There are some cool characters, but it's a little unclear who is who and what exactly the story will be about...
