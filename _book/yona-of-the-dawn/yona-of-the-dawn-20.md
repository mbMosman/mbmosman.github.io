Cleary I am a bit biased, as I absolutely LOVE this story... However I do continue to be surprised by the way the characters and their emotions are portrayed. It's great to see Lili step up here, and Hak too... I don't wanna spoil this, but ... I guess I need to just stop here or I will.

Things are building and I feel mysteries are on the verge of becoming clear or at least clearer.
