So finally I'm getting unspoiled for me story - things that I didn't read years ago off the internet. Super exciting. It's great to get a little Blue Dragon time, but I also enjoyed seeing Lili & Yona together again and having some girl time chatting about the boys. 

I finished this last night, after just getting it in the mail - couldn't wait to dive in. On this morning's bus ride I was reading an article on Anime/Manga Fandom focused on the MML (Miyazaki Mailing List). The article was discussing reasons for their appreciation of Miyazaki's work, and one of them that struck a chord with me was a lack of clarity around good & evil. While I've certainly enjoyed the good vs evil story at times, particularly I think when I was younger. The stories that resonate with me now are the ones where characters are more realistically not so easily classified. Bringing this back to Yona of the Dawn, how should we view Su-Won? He killed Yona's father, but perhaps he's providing for and bettering the kingdom in ways her peace-loving father could not... Seeing the characters come to terms with this is, for me, what takes this beyond a fun/adventure/romance, and sparks imagination and curiosity to make it an amazing and engaging story.

I'm really curious how this will resolve. Clearly I'm cheering for the Yona & Hak match up, but what will become of the Dragon Warriors and the kingdom?
