We get to learn even more about Zeno here too... <spoiler>In particular, that he can't die and is one of the original dragon warriors.</spoiler> His story is pretty heart-wrentching. It's amazing what he has gone through and still manages to have a pretty upbeat and cheery demeanor. The character building in this story really shines through in this volume.
