So here things continue down a more serious path as Su-Won leads the nation off to war. Yona and friends venture off toward the border as well and bump into a young boy from oft contested territory that snuck across the border to see what things were like. As they get him home, they get pulled into the fray as they try to keep his village safe from the defeated, retreating army bent on burning everything to the ground so there is nothing left for the victors.

We learn a lot more in about those with the dragon's powers in this volume, and also a lot more about Zeno in particular. The end is heart-renchingly sad, but miraculously ends well all things considered. <spoiler>It's interesting that Zeno calls himself Yona's shield...</spoiler>
