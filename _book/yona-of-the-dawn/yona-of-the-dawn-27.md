Oh how fulfilling this was!  Yes, this is something of a lull between story arcs, but it had some great character moments contained within. I loved seeing poor Yona all flustered over Hak's confession, and Hak's reaction to it himself is also infinitely entertaining to me as well. Hmmm... I wonder if maybe I see a bit of myself in that...
