This seems to be winding down this story arc, which I liked well enough but also feel like it is getting old. It's been interesting to see the various reactions to Yona, Hak & the dragon warriors coming out more into the open. I'm so curious to see how things will wrap in the end, but I'm not in too much of a hurry for the story there either.
