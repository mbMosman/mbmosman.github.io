I forgot how much I adored the first book until I picked up the 2nd. Ceony is a little annoying at times but I feel like looking back at my own early 20’s that she’s probably a more well done character than I want to believe. There are consequences from her less than smart decisions and that makes for a bittersweet ending. 

I’d definitely read another, though I'm not in a hurry for it either...
