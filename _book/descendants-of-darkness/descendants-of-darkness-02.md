I can tell that this is older... The character art reminds me a bit of Trigun, with Tsuzuki and Hisoka resembling Meryl and Milly in the big, glassy eyes and the shape of their faces.  They come across in some places feeling very doe-eyed and feminine and in other places Tsuzuki in particular has more rectangular, masculine seeming eyes. It took a bit even in the first say 10 pages or so to convince myself that yes these were the same characters. The art style overall feels more flowery, which I'm not sure is a reflection of age or era, but it feels a bit over done to me. 

The first chapter of this was an independent story, while the remaining four chapters were a continued storyline, The Devil's Trill. The first chapter got me up to speed on Tsuzuki and Hisoka's background, in that they are shinigami who work for the king of the Underworld, bringing in people who are supposed to die but are too attached to the world to do so. Tsuzuki seems to be the lead, but appears to let his emotions get the better of him, while Hisoka looks cute and boyish, but is cold and focused.

The remaining chapters, the Devil's Trill, focus on a young violinist who get's a cornea transplant which contains a demon's contracts marked on it. The demon then repeatedly tries to kill him while Tsuzuki and Hisoka try to keep him alive and track the demon through a cursed violin. The story seems pretty straightforward, but there are some confusing aspects coming to light as I try to recap... for example was the violin itself really cursed? It was the cornea that held the contract with the demon, right? Anyhow, it was a decent enough story and the details didn't seem that important while reading through the first time. I will try to avoid any real spoilers here, but Tsuzuki seems to be the more powerful of the two, with Hisoka trying to catch up and become more like him. It's an interesting pair since Hisoka also seems the more responsible.

There were some pretty confusing aspects in this volume, which I'm willing to attribute to starting in volume 2, not volume 1. I've got 3 & 4 sitting here, so I'll give them a go as well before deciding if it is worth continuing through the rest of the 12 volume series.
