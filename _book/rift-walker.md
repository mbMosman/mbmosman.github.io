As a continuation of the story from Greyfriar, this isn't exactly disappointing, as it does continue the story of Adele and Gareth. However, it doesn't really satisfy as a full and complete story on its own in the way the first did. It is interesting to see how Adele and Gareth handle their separation and return to their own lives, but this also feels like it centers more around romance and doesn't feel as well thought through in other areas.
