I left the last book with a lot of anger at what was done to Jennifer at the end of the story. I’m not really sure why I picked up this next book, except perhaps out of a sense of obligation to finish the trilogy and see how things play out. Perhaps I imagined that the those things wouldn't happen again and I could kind of forget. Well, that was not to be. Things were going well enough for a short time, and I was just about to forget if not forgive, when we learn Jennifer is pregnant with (of course) the child of the big bad evil that raped her> To top it off, she is of course hopeful this son will be good and turn the tide against his father. 

__Argh!!!__ I had several conversations about DNF-ing the book at that point. But I'm stubborn, and I saw it through to the end. Was I rewarded for my efforts? No, not really. 

A bit further into the book, the story of King Arthur is brought in and we learn Jennifer is Guinevere reborn. Since their 3rd tragic figure (Lancelot) isn’t there in this go-around, maybe in this life they will find peace. Alas, for poor battered and abused Jennifer, of course that isn't to be. Later we find Lancelot is awakened from the dead too, and while this isn’t resolved before the end of this book, I find I just really don't care.  Seriously, I've read a lot of takes on King Arthur, but seriously?! Here??? UGH!!!

This will be the end of the Fionavar road for me, and honestly I wish I had never touched any of these books.
