I have been aiming to make tastier food while cooking at home this fall, and this has really helped. I've put together a few herb & spice blends in some pepper mills, and it's been fun trying them out. In particular, there's one recipe called Rosemary's Blend that includes Allspice and Fennel that is AMAZING on eggs. It's become my go to breakfast seasoning.
