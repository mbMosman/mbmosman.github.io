This was pretty awesome. I was a little worried that I wouldn't like this after being pretty much entirely disgusted with the author's Fionavar Tapestry, but I needn't have feared. The things that I hated there were if not entirely missing from this book, they were at least toned down and less of a focus. 
  
This is something of a fanatasy classic, and I'm quite surprised it escaped me for so long.  The story overall was pretty solid. I was only mildly irritated by the seemingly out of no where love connection between two of the main characters that popped up in the end. The story explored some really interesting ideas and themes, and was well paced, had solid characters, and it flowed well. 

I'd say it's worth a 2nd read later on.
