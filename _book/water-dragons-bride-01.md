This is an cute, but kinda dark, first volume. The main character is just a little girl as she is mysteriously pulled through a little pond in her modern day backyard into another world where she is sacrificed (weighted down and pushed into a lake to drown) as an offering/bride of the local water god/dragon. 

<span class="spoiler">The water dragon isn't keen on her at first, and it seems he's let previous offerings simply drown.
But this girl talks back, and has green eyes and red hair, so he is intrigued and decides to make her his bride.
She then refuses him, and the other gods tease him for it. He takes her voice and nearly starves her to death, but is he cruel or just naive? There's also a little boy from the village who tries to rescue her. </span>

Lot's of interesting characters and room for the story to grow.
