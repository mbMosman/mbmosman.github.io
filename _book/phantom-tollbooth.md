This was exactly what I needed right now. A perfectly clever, fun, and easy read. It's a kids book after all.

Still, while being a kids book, it's got a lot to think about in there even for adults. Great messages hidden (or not so hidden) in the adventure, like how not thinking & wasting time can lead to undesirable outcomes. It's all just so well done, that while some of the messages are pretty obvious, it's fun more so that shaming. The point being that we're going to make mistakes, but if we don't need to feel bad about that if we've learned from them. That alone is a great message that everyone needs to hear and be reminded of.
