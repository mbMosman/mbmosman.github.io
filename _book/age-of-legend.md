Well, this new trilogy is off to a great start. In fact I enjoyed this so much that when I realized I'd be waiting forever in the library queque for the next book, I decided to pick up a hardcover copy of my own. Of course while doing that pre-ordering the last book only made sense, and then of course it wouldn't do to have only the last two books in the series so I got all the others too.
