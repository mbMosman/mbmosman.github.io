I enjoyed this, but didn't *love* it. If I hadn't just picked up the 2nd book from a library hold, I'm not sure I would have bothered. It's a neat idea, but I'm just not feeling very invested in any of the characters or where the story is going. Maybe I'll find I like the next volume more and that it pulls me in...
