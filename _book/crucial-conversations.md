This is amazing... I was really skeptical about this going in, but by the halfway mark I was sold. I've now ordered a copy of my own (all the better to loan) and one to send to my mom as a joint read/re-read. 

Especially over this last year, it's been more and more obvious to me that I need help in this area. For whatever reason, my emotions have been taking over more and more in these important conversations throughout my life. While I want to get my ideas out, I often find it hard to find space to do so, and often just retreat to silence. Worse, I tend to only make that effort when the stakes are high and I care so much that I forget to listen and be respectful to other views.
