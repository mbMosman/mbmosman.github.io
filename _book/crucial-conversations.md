This is amazing... I was really skeptical about this going in, but by the halfway mark I was sold. I got it from the library, with a waiting list, so it must go back. Fortunately it's a quick enough read. However it's something I want to be able to come back to again and again. I've now ordered a copy of my own (all the better to loan & reread) and one to send to my mom as a joint read/re-read. 

Especially over this last year, it's been more and more obvious to me that I need help in this area. For whatever reason, my emotions have been so much more intense in these important conversations recently than earlier in life. Is this getting older? Is it just that the conversations are more important? I'm not sure. However, while I want to get my ideas out, I'm finding it harder to do so, and then get frustrated and retreat to silence. I tend to only push myself past that when the stakes are so high and I care so much, and then I often get so wrapped up in the importance of speaking up that I forget to listen and be respectful to other views.

I'm now much more aware of not just the problem, but reasons behind it, so I hope that this will help me learn to build better skills for handling difficult conversations. I'm at a point in life where so many areas of my life will suffer if I don't learn to improve in this area. This book has given me the tools to do that.
