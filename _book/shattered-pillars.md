Well... I got about what I expected from this second book of the series. Honestly I would have liked to see all this wrapped up in a single book. Trilogies are starting to feel standard, even if there isn't really story enough to support them all. 

The plot feels drawn out for no apparent reason. I don't really see much purpose in a lot of the adventures, at least as far as the overall outcome go. There might be some cases where characters are just so strong and interesting that I can't get enough of reading about them. None of the characters here really do that for me. The closest it comes is Bansch, the horse, but as she's becoming more miraculous I'm even losing interest here.

Our main man Temur frankly is pretty lame. He lacks ambitioun and can't really seem to manage anything on his own. Fortunately he's got the wizard Samarkar to guide him through everything. She's a bit more interested, with a good dose of spunky, but I can't really fathom what is truly in it all for her. Hrahima, the tiger lady, could be super cool, and I'll totally fess up to being partial to characters with a feline vibe. However, while she's mysterious and powerful, there's almost too much mystery. We get a hint into what drives her in this volume, and I feel like it should be emotional, but it wasn't really.  I just don't have the feels for any of these folks. 

So, there's a third book... My current verdict is that Iâ€™ll continue for the sake of wrap-up, but I'm not super excited for it. It'll likely be a while before I get around to it.
