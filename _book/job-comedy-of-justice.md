After watching American Gods, I had a desire to do a little re-reading of both that book and this one, as the idea of belief shaping reality is an interesting theme, and I couldn't really recall how that played into this story. Turns out it doesn't much, at least not in the way I thought I remembered. 

That part aside, I didn't enjoy the re-read as much as thought. I recall being really enamored with the story when I was younger. It's hard to read a book where women have so little role outside of being pleasing to men. It's nice to see that they can enjoy sex for their own sake, but argh. I get that the book was written in a different time, and I can appreciate that the book pushed the status quo of the time in many areas while still being disappointed that Margrethe couldn't have had more smarts displayed throughout the story. 

Despite disappointing women's roles however, I think like the re-told Job story. I love seeing the changes in Alec as he goes from a strict Bible-thumping, heaven-bound soul to a saint in heaven who jumps ship for hell to find the woman he loves. It's thoughtfully told. I love his inner rationalizations which get crazier and crazier as his slide progress. There are also some great jabs at what I like to think of as crazier religious beliefs - Does the earth from space look flat to the "flat-earthers"?, the world is only x number of years old but god made it with fossils and such to look older just to mess with people, etc.
