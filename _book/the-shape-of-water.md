This was simply amazing! The story was beautifully written. While the destination was never in doubt, the path was still worth lingering over. The cast of characters was perfect, and the intermingling between them so superbly done. There was enough detail to bring the cast to life and make them real without extraneous detail to slow the pace. Definitely one of the best books Iâ€™ve read this year.
