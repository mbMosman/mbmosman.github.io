I picked this up because I've really enjoyed other books from this author, but hadn't read this one yet. It's also considered by some to be something of a classic. I wouldn't call it that at all, and it is by far my least favorite book by this author. 

While I should have expected it, I was a little miffed by it being something of a *portal fantasy*. That left me a bit miffed with the book from the start, until I finally managed to put that aside somewhere around 1/2 way through. Then I got to the part near the end, where <span class="spoiler">Jennifer is raped by the 'big bad', first in the form of her father (in her mother's bed), then as her priest, and yet again as her friend/boyfriend. Given the big bad is a god of sorts, that feels like a rather unnecessary horror. It wasn't particularly graphic, but really I think a god could find better ways to mess with someone's mind for torture & abuse.</span> 

While I enjoyed many of the characters and the way their experiences in this world changed them, on the whole everything came across more flat and dull than I expected. In addition, the looming evil also doesn't really __loom__, and it can almost be forgotten until the big *boom* at the end. I suppose that leads us on nicely to the next book, but the end paints a picture of this devious plotting that was done, yet there's so little evidence of this throughout the book that I feel an opportunity for suspense and foreboding was missed.

I'll move on to the next one, but reluctantly...
