I read came upon this after my adventures with Gate 7, and it's missing ending, wanting something with an ending to fill my need for more lovely CLAMP art. The art style is older, but has a bit more whimsy to it than more recently published stuff I've read. I rather like it... 

The story is said to be based in Indian mythology, which sadly I know little to nothing about. I'm not sure if it would help to have some basis there to help with getting into the story, but it was a bit hard to follow. Things kick off with a prophecy and a child who should bring about doom for our main character while also overthrowing the tyrant god-king. They'll need to gather up 6 stars to join them... That's clear enough, but who is who and why they matter is a bit harder for me to follow. There's a good number of characters introduced through this first omnibus volume, some of whom it's easier to follow and place than others. Well, and some end up dead before you get too much time to worry about them. 

I'm intrigued, but not sure if I really like it or not.
