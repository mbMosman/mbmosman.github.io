Well, that was not the end I would have predicted, but I'd say overall it was pretty fulfilling. I'm not really familiar with the Rigveda story or characters, but now I'm curious how much of the story is borrowed and how much is reinvented for the manga. I'll have to put that on my to-read list now. 

Overall, enjoyed the story, but wished there was a little more story lurking in the background. Everything seemed very matter of fact, without much teaser lead-ins. There wasn't really room to wonder what would happen next as it was either extremely obvious or beyond imagining. Good adventure, great art, but definitely a cut-and-dry grand battle adventure.
