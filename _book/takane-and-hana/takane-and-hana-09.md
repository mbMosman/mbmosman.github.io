So... the last volume ended with Hana's family and Takane moving into the same house due to his grandfather the Chairman's scheming. It picks right up with that, and neither party seemed particularly happy, although Hana's family is much more on board, with really no other choice. It felt so cruel to see them played that way. It was refreshing though to see Hana be the one that confronts the Chairman on it while Takane was basically turned away. At least he had the heart to see her, and while I have to assume the "juice" thing was a jab, she managed to show some spunk right back. The comedy meter was lower here as things become more serious with Okamon finally stepping up to the plate too.
