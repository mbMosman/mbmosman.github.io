For a much of the last volume, it felt like things were getting pretty serious, but this one had me laughing out loud again. Hana and Takane are back at it in full. However, it is also interesting to see how things are changing as Hana really starts owning up to having feelings for Takane. It's also pretty sad that she feels she has to hide it, but at the same time, given their age difference, how else would it play out. The ending is certainly interesting... and of course it kinda cliff-hangers there, so I guess I'll be waiting a while to see where it goes.
