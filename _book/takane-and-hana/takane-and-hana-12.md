Previously Hana told Takane how she felt, and was pushed away. Now following the rescue of the previous volume, Takane tells Hana he loves her, only to be similarly rejected. That brings things full circle as Takane goes all out to try to win Hana's acceptance, which of course only annoys her and drives them further apart. To get Hana some space, Okamon tells Takane he and Hana are dating now, but is it just pretend or are there ulterior motives...
