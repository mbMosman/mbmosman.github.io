This was a very interesting tale... The story was the telling of a story itself. A rather interesting way of going about things. It was interesting to pick up on how the story being told related to the teller and the audience. 

Enjoyable, but not really a easy read. I read this while there were many interruptions and distractions, and I think I might have enjoyed it more if I could have tuned out other things a bit more to just focus in on reading. I would have liked the chance to be more enveloped in the story and its mysteries.
