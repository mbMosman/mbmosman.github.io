I think this an an absolutely __*amazing*__ book. It's a tough read to go cover-to-cover (which was my initial intent), however the intro is a solid and interesting read, and the personality type chapters are also easy to read through and digest, though I found my interest waning if I couldn't identify the type with a person I knew. 

The little bits of background and history throughout the book were really interesting to me, and I love the connections to older tales meant to inform and grow. She makes connections for each type to both Homer's *The Odyssey* and Dante's *Inferno* which maybe feel a little dark or insulting at times, but also I think give an interesting historical perspective and authenticity to the vices and virtues of these types. 

That said though, I think that vices/virtues bit is the part I struggled with the most in the book. I found the labels for them to be a bit off-putting, though if you can push through that and read what lies beyond, there's helpful and insightful stuff there. If for example the vice is "laziness" and you're thinking about someone you see as more athletic and *active*, it feels like a misfit, but if you can *read all the words* you might see beyond that narrowness. Perhaps while laziness in physical activity doesn't fit, laziness or inattention in some other aspect of their life - attention to detail, cleanliness, etc. - does.
