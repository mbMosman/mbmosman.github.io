When we last left Asahi, she had been sent home. I enjoyed seeing her back home, with her family. It was also neat to see the what went on in the world she left behind without her. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that I'm glad to see the tone/pace hasn't really changed much. However to keep plot moving, there's drama with a hint of danger at the end too.
