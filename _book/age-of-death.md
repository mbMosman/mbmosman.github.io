I can't say I'm loving the cliff-hangers in this new trilogy, but at least I should be getting the next volume tomorrow to help kill the suspense!

I was pretty impressed with the journey through the underworld. It had more risk, danget and insight than I would have expected for characters that are now, well, dead.
