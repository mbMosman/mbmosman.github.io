Oh ho! This volume has a nice little twist on things... <spoiler>Takane has all his riches taken away and is shuffled into a low-end life. He doesn't tell Hana, just stops seeing her. When she hunts him down, he says some very cruel things.</spoiler>

There's a lot of questioning of feelings and values in this volume and it takes this a bit beyond casual light read for humor that the story has been so far. Several of the characters are faced with moments where they need to stop and question the status quo and have an opportunity then to stretch and grow. We'll have to see what they make of these opportunities in the next volume as few of those outcomes are contained within.  I like where this is headed, but I still have a hard time seeing this plot hold out for too many more volumes.
