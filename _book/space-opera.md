I think this book is a potential fav for the right people... I'm just not that right person, right now.  Maybe I could be later, but this book is chock full of non-sensical humor, and don't think I was in the right mood for that when I read it either. (Long waitlist at the library, and it just came at a bad time. I cram-read it a few days before it was due.)

Timing aside, I feel like there were just some things that I wasn't going to get regardless. I don't have a big pop-culture vocab, even smaller music vocab, and so some of the little jokes were probably right over my head. If you're more into the music scene, and humor, this might be more for you.

I do find that I like *some* humor books. I loved Terry Pratchet for example, and likewise enjoyed reading Douglas Adams. However, I think though that this is a little weaker than those on story/plot/character in favor of the nonsense humor. There are paragraphs & pages that I would read and realize that they were (almost) entirely unimportant outside of the long, humorous and nonsensical description of some alien world & species. I say almost, because inevitably a character from that place pops up later and some bit of that becomes more relevant. However I ended up skimming/skipping huge chunks of these sections later in the book. I can only pin it on burnout. There was just so much of it that it stopped being funny, and began to make the book feel tedious. 

I ended up thinking the book was OK. I might have been hoping for a different ending, but found the actual one pretty fitting in its own way. I've enjoyed other books from this author, and wouldn't discount her just from this book. However I do think I'll be more skeptical of books that rely more on humor in the future - both in terms of when I choose to read them & in what my expectations are before diving in.
