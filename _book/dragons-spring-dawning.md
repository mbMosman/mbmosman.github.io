Well, overall I enjoyed reading through the series, for what I'm certain now was the first time. There's no way I would have forgotten this ending. Part of me wants to say it was all a bit over the top, but somehow it also seemed quite fitting. It was a relatively happy ending, though it wasn't so *ride off into the sunset* that it felt fake, which I appreciated. 

Neither Cameron nor Raistlin were my favorite characters, but I'm glad they were able to find their own paths. Of all the threads through the story, I found Raistlin's the hardest to follow and understand. I assume that was at least somewhat intentional, and not just my own haphazard reading, lack of focus, and bad memory. 

I found Tanis somewhat despicable overall, but his talk in the end on how he couldn't love another until he loved himself was at least more understandable to me. Laurana managed to stay somewhat annoying to me throughout, though I see in here things I've come to respect in other characters - perhaps Princess Yona of Yona of the Dawn. I'm glad she stood up for herself & saved herself in the end, yet to have given up so much for love and then abandoned him at that critical moment... Ah, I get it, but to come so far for someone then run out on them? To trust so much, then so little? And what of saving the world? At least Tanis took down a dragonlord.

Overall, my favorite character was Flint. It was sad to see him go, and heartbreaking to see Tas left behind so devastated. Perhaps it is really Tas that I related to the most. I don't know that I was ever that carefree, but there was a long part of life where I think I avoided thinking about how the things I did might effect others. I was too wrapped up in my own thoughts and life to really see. I like to think I've learned from my own heartbreaks, much as Tas did. Sometimes you need to focus more clearly on the now and everything that is a part of it, before that now is gone away.
