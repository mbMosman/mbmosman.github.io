This was a great story! It feels a bit like reading a war history, but yet the characters are so interesting and engaging that I couldn't help but want to see what becomes of them. Their futures feel real in the moment, and their fates never feel certain. Some stories have a happier end than others, but it never goes so far as to feel like the death drama that Martin's books are. For something I picked up in the library just because it was a 1st book that was there, I thoroughly enjoyed this and am looking forward to reading the next.
