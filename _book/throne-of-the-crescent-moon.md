I've had this on my too read list for a long, long time now but wasn't willing to buy it and was too lazy to get the physical copy from the library, but that was before I was working walking distance away with my fancy new job! I'm sorry now that I waited so long, but am very glad to have finally read it.  

It wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever read, and it wasn't particularly deep or thought provoking. However it was a really good solid read. The writing was great, characters interesting, and the story well-paced without giving too much away in advance and never being too predictable in its outcomes. It was also refreshingly short, while still being a whole and worthy stand alone story. (Yes, there's a series, but it ends nicely and stands well on it's own.)
