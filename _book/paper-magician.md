This was a freebie Kindle-First read for me. On the whole, I've not found them to be particularly great, and in fact there are SO many that I have gotten, but can't seem to make time to actually read. Fortunately, this one had a cool title and interesting premise. Magic papercraft? Cool. Sucked me in, and I'm glad. I adored this book. 

It was a lovely story, sweet & touching, with a good bit of adventure, hint of darkness, and just the right touch of romance. It is one I would pass along to my nieces when they're just a wee bit older... Of course that means I'd actually have to buy a copy. So... What becomes of kindle books when you pass on anyway? Can one inherit a kindle library? Hmmm...
