At first I was a little put of by the bits of the modern world intermixed with magic and fantasy. However the characters and story were more than enough to make up for it and hold my interest. There were points early on where I couldnâ€™t imagine how all these things would pull together and fit, but of course they do. Beautifully at that.

Patricia McKillip is a beautiful writer. There is magic in her words. The way that she shapes the characters and story is just done so amazingly well.
