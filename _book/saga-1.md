I've read a lot about this and seen many a great review. I can't even begin to list the number of awards it has won. So I got suckered in and felt like I needed to give it a go. It isn't really bad, I mean I get a sense it could be a really interesting story, but honestly it's just not my thing. To each their own.

It's a cool idea - inter-racial/species? couple out to save their kid despite a war that wants them both dead... Bounty hunters, ghosts, creepy alien creatures... The story itself seems fine, and it's kinda cool to see it narrated by the kid.  I think it's just a bit crude for me... Creepy naked, armless spider/human thing... Sextillion a pleasure planet w/ anything you could want including a 6 year old slave girl who will do anything you ask (thankfully mercenary wants to rescue her instead of use her)... Ghost-girl w/ guts hanging out... mom discover's she like taste of her own breast milk because baby spits up in her mouth... The art is also rather classic comic, but meh, it just doesn't grab my attention.
