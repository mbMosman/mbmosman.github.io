This was on my list for a long time now... I had tried to find it a while ago, and couldn't get a library copy, so it sat forgotten on my list. I was cleaning that up, and before deleting this I thought I'd give the library one last go. And there it was, e-book and even Kindle version. Still I haven't read a book on the Kindle in ages, so it sat there for a few days too, but then I got sick and what better to do while you are sick in bed than read a book. Perfect, no?

So again, I hadn't realized that I was biting into a series, but no one can write just one book anymore, so I shouldn't have been surprised. Still, this time I think I will be looking for the others. The vampire thing is kinda forgotten these days, so it sends me back a bit, kinda quaint. These vampires are some sort of parasitic creature rather than re-lifed humans, but it hardly matters. Their abilities are sorta explained by science, I suppose to fit into the old steam-punk world feel. It hardly matters though, while the setting and characters are a little different, it's a good ol' vampire romance.

That aside, it was an enjoyable sick-day read. Nothing too deep or surprising, but yet a well written story that delivers on expectations. Oh! And there are cats! Also, despite the trilogy thing, this book does wrap itself up very nicely while still leaving open doors for more. I really appreciate that.
