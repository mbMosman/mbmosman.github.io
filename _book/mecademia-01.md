This is the first volume of a series of scholarly articles around anime and manga. This volume explores the interactive worlds created by anime and manga. While I was expecting that to mean world-building, the topics are much more broad, but no less interesting. As an example, my favorite article was the article on the MML (Miyazaki Mailing List) discussing *fandom* as it relates to that group. There's also an article on cosplay, several on how anime/manga has affected culture's around the world, and one on the changing image of Japanese girls. It's actually ended up being much more interesting than I initially expected, and has brought a lot more depth to my appreciation of anime and manga.
