The first 3 volumes of [QQ Sweeper](/manga/qq-sweeper.html) did nice set up, but the plot in this continuation of the story really picked up. Some of the relationship between Fumi & Kyutaro feels a little oddly contrived, but I'm willing to forgive that because they characters are just so darn cute. I love Fumi's rather single-minded determination, and Kyutaro's fear of small talk and "noncompoop" status is rather endearing. 

Also, I am 100% in agreement with Kyutaro on the ordering online to avoid having to chat with sales staff in clothing stores. <3
