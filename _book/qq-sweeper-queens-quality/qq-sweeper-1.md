This sounded so amazingly cheesy. I was really skeptical picking it up, but since it was from the author of Dengeki Daisy I thought I'd give it a go and see if I enjoyed it just as much. This first volume is a little slow and frankly the cleaning and sweeping is just a little odd, but I find the heroine and her Cinderella dream rather annoyingly endearing.
