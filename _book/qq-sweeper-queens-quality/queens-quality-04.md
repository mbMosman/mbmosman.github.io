This was the last one available as I read through these from the library initially, but I'm excited to see the series continue. The idea is kinda neat - sweeping the bad thoughts from people's minds - and the characters are fun. If you liked Dengeki Daisy, I think you'd also like this. The characters are similar without being too much the same.
