Yay! Finally getting to parts of the story I haven't read already!!! 

It's nice to see that Riri is growing a bit and cares so much about her people. She's also a great reminder of who Yona was before to contrast with who she is now. The standoff at the end left me hanging... 

<p class="spoiler">Why is Zeno so interested in Su-won? What does he see in him I wonder? A sword maybe? Hmmm....</p>
