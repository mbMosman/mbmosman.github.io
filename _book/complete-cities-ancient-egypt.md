I was looking at some upcoming games on Steam and found a new Egyptian city builder game. After trying to make my way through their demo, I started to wonder how cities really were laid out. How did people live? What kind of building were present in the city to support them? We're all familiar with the pyramids and tombs, but how did the common people live? A little digging on the internet brought me to this book.

I was hoping to learn more about how the general population of these ancient cities may have lived, and sadly it seems there is just not much evidence around this. There are some snippets of that here in this book though, and I have to say that was presented well enough along with the explanations of why there isn't more of it. It is pretty high level, without a lot of detail into any one city, but that's what I expected based on the title, so I didn't mind that so much.
