This was a pick from Goodreads as it was a nominee for the [Goodreads Choice Award](https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/21332-goodreads-choice-award) both for Fantasy and Debut Author in 2018, though it didn't win either. It lost the fantasy award to Circe by Madeline Miller, which is on my to-read list but has a nice long library wait list. It lost the debut author to Tomi Adeyemi's Children of Blood and Bone, which seems intriguing if a little dark, also on the to-read, but waiting list. Winning isn't everything, though. Despite this having me a little worried about it being another take on Hunger Games, this seemed the most interesting to me from the nominee list last year. 

We'll have to see how it turns out...
