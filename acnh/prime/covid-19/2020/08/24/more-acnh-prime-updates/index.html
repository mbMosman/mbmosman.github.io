  <p>Well, the weekend was pretty laid back, so it’s mostly Animal Crossing news here… O’Hare has decided to sail for new adventures. Oh, darn. We all pretended to be sad, but really weren’t all that disappointed.</p>

<p>Honestly, I was just miffed it took so long! He decided Friday evening that Catini wasn’t for him. Then spent all day Saturday packing, and finally on Sunday his lot was up for sale again. Woot! We also had a camper, Rolf, visiting the island. He didn’t win me over, so I didn’t encourage him to stay. I spent most of the gaming day visiting islands one after the other to find a <em>cool</em> new villager that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>didn’t repeat an animal type already on the island</li>
  <li>seemed like they might fit in with the others without being too weird</li>
</ol>

<p>I had no idea that would be so difficult! To recap the fun…</p>

<p>I met the hamster Clay twice, and despite seeming kinda cool, I am sold on Apple (also a hamster), so he was out. There was the eagle Celia, but she seemed pretty <em>meh</em> and frankly the eagles and chickens just look weird. The duck, Joey, popped up and also seemed pretty <em>meh</em>, as did Benjamen the dog. Curt the bear just seemed rude, and I didn’t want another jock so no Coach the bull.</p>

<p>I was kinda excited to meet Zucker, the octopus that looks like a takoyaki. Despite being super cute, he was just too over the top for me and Catini. I can deal with them being animals, but to have them look like food? That’s a little too weird. After going back and forth with indecision, I had started to lean toward allowing his cuteness to win. I <em>almost</em> took the bite, I mean bait. Conveniently though, I was chatting with my mom while playing and <em>forgot</em> to invite him before leaving the island. I call that fate.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Anicotti the mouse was my last island discovery. She was cute, but I worried she might try to take over Apple’s bit of Catini pop-stardom. (Not to mention one overly excitable villager is more than enough for the introvert in me.) So despite staying up way too late saying just one more island… I never actually found someone to invite. No big deal I thought. There’s always tomorrow, right?</p>

<p><strong><em>WRONG!</em></strong> When I finally got back to Catini after work today, I popped out to a mystery island to find no one there… Just the cherry trees and fish. What?!!! Did I accidentally invite someone without realizing it?  I headed back home and peeked at the lot and sure enough it was SOLD. Sold to Kitt, who I was pretty confident I had not met yet. Looking her up, I discover Kitt is a kangaroo, and I have not met one of those yet, so she must have been wrangled in by Mr Nook. I kinda thought the same thing about Snooty, as I didn’t think I would have invited a second anteater, but I wasn’t really certain. Darn that Nook! Has to get his money, doesn’t he?!!!</p>

<p>Fortunately Kitt doesn’t seem to odd, and as a kangaroo does fill the requirement of being a new type of animal. She also doesn’t seem particularly cute or intereting though. Oh well. I guess we’ll see Wednesday what type of personality and interests she has. Bummer that they have to spend a whole day cleaning after they move in. I guess I can kind understand though. (This game tries so hard to teach me patience on the one hand, while making me regret sleeping with the other. ARGH!!!)</p>

<p>To end again on a non-gaming note, my students got to meet their group project clients today. Super excited to see how these projects shape up. They are all really awesome, and also so very different from each other. I know I always say they are cool, but truly they always are. I’m always impressed at the projects that we get to work on. Woot! Four weeks to Paxos graduation!</p>
