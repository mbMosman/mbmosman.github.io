  <p>Woo-hoo! So my brother got the Switch must faster than anticipated, and they’ve been enjoying Animal Crossing (among other things) all weekend too! It takes a lot to beat that, but as icing on the cake, my Paxos cohort presented their awesome solo projects this morning too. Woot!!!</p>

<p>Anyhow, the Switch / Animal Crossing thing has been awesome. I am still totally hooked, and now add to that I actually get texts from my brother!!! Woot! I don’t think we’ve talked this much in … well forever. Maybe since I graduated college. Woot!</p>

<p>And of course seeing my virtual nieces isn’t quite the same as seeing my <em>actual</em> nieces, but given that we live half-way across the country from each other, it’s pretty darn awesome!</p>

<p><img alt="My nieces sitting on a bench in Animal Crossing" src="/assets/2020/08/17/acnh-megan-abby-f33afd96cf2a0c5943fe969aaf19b02f05e051d2547cae77d61206880f61c1d6.jpg" /></p>

<p>Outside of now getting some regular <em>family time</em> with my brother and his family, my island is growing, I’ve now got a two-story house, complete with an outrageous loan to repay, a full compliment of 10 villagers, and the island is hosting a performance of K.K. Slider tonight! This is an awesome achievement for Catini.</p>

<p>Of course I’m already starting to have some … <em>regrets</em> shall we say, in my island planning. Why did I put that building here?! Why did I just totally accept the first 8 strangers I met on those mystery islands?! Much of this stems from <em>cheating</em> a bit and peeking at game info on the net, which I refused to do initially as it takes a good amount of joy out of the game. All it took was peeking at all the awesomely cute potential villagers to become totally unhappy with my own crew!</p>

<p>However, I’m trying to just chill a little. Sometimes I get just a wee bit too wrapped up in wanting things to be just right, and neglect appreciating the things I do have. So as I said, I am trying to chill a bit. After all, while it’ll cost me, I can now move things around on the island.</p>

<p>The villagers might be a different issue though… I guess they can decide to leave, but I sounds like it takes some work to make that actually happen. Even if they do go, I don’t really get to choose who will come either, so what good is longing for that quirky cat, fancy ostrich, or sassy unicorn?</p>

<p>Currently my island crew consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Antonio">Antonio</a> - Sports jock anteater… He was an initial villager, while loud and annoying at times, he’s grown on me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Shari">Shari</a> - Sock-doll monkey. My other initial villager. She can also be annoying at times, but <em>so</em> makes up for it others… like when I’ve been stung by wasps and she gives me medicine. (It took me a two weeks to figure out I could net them if I were smart!)</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Apple_(villager)">Apple</a> - Shiney red pop-star wanna be hamster. Super cute, but also a bit on the loud and enthusiastic side. Totally adore her though. Alfonso made her sad one day and she tried to leave, but I wouldn’t let her go.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Alfonso">Alfonso</a> - Strange bug loving aligator. He’s ok I guess, but a little odd… He doesn’t seem to really get along with anyone else though, so especially after he upset Apple, I’m now hoping he’ll decide to go.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tia">Tia</a> - Super cute teapot elephant. Don’t tell Apple, but she’s my favorite islander so far. So friendly and so darn cute!!!</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Leopold">Leopold</a> - A smug looking lion… that seems to live in a school room. He seemed cool at first, but now he seems too good for the rest of us and I just think he’s a bit weird. He was my first campsite visitor and I wish I had just let him continue on his journey.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Snooty_(villager)">Snooty</a> - Another anteater, but all pink and quite, well, snooty. I really would like to have different types of animals versus two of the same, so hoping she might think the style suits her better elsewhere too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/O%27Hare">O’Hare</a> - Odd little bunny who seems to live on islands in his house… It’s got a sea floor, with island rugs and a shark statue. I thought Leopold had strange taste, but this is what he calls home? He seemed cool enough when we met, but he really doesn’t seem to be fitting in. Maybe the winds of change will call to him…</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Eugene">Eugene</a> - 50’s greaser Koala. He kind reminds me of the Fonz, but he lives in an office? He’s a strange one, but he’s totally grown on me. I think it was when Antonio gifted him a Dracula costume and he put it on… I literally laughed out loud, told him it was questionable, and he took it off embarassed. “It never happened!”, he said, but now he walks around town all the time wearing it. He must never leave.</li>
  <li><a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Lobo">Lobo</a> - A purple wolf, with a deep voice and yellow eyes. Poor guy seemed lost but content when we met on a mystery island, and well all I can say was it was love at first sight. He’s an odd little wolf cookie, but plays some rockin’ tunes and has a chess set on his table. (Not that I play, but still it’s a good combo.) He too must never leave. ^.^</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, I’m already plotting how to get about half my population voted off the island… What is wrong with me?! I’d never think or do such things in real life, or would I? Is this game bringing out the worst in me?</p>

<p>On a non-gaming footnote, had my friend Dave over for some awesome grilling on Saturday! It was fun to have someone over as grilling for one just sounds kinda lame, plus how was I ever going to eat a whole rack of ribs myself?! The ribs turned out really well, which was pretty amazing since I’ve never grilled them myself before. I was quite pleased, especially since there was enough for us both to take home left-overs for lunch the next day. Totally looking forward to doing this again soon!</p>
