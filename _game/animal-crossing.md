Well, I'm pretty hooked on this game... It's been the savior of the Switch for me, and has become something of a daily ritual. It's also become a sort of family thing, as my brother and family are on it now too. Cool to be able to play with my nieces living across the country. Woot!

I've wondered at times if the game really brings out the best in me as I try to master plan my dream island layout and it's residents. I was initially just inviting who ever I ran into to come live on my island. Then I started having regrets, and seeing that there were cooler folks I might be able to lure in... So I stopped talking to some folks, and they moved on and a tiny part of me felt a bit bad about it. 

Currently my island crew consists of:

- [Antonio](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Antonio) - Sports jock anteater... He was an initial villager, while loud and annoying at times, he's grown on me.
- [Shari](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Shari) - Sock-doll monkey. My other initial villager. She can also be annoying at times, but *so* makes up for it others... like when I've been stung by wasps and she gives me medicine. (It took me a two weeks to figure out I could net them if I were smart!) 
- [Apple](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Apple_(villager)) - Shiney red pop-star wanna be hamster. Super cute, but also a bit on the loud and enthusiastic side. Totally adore her though. Alfonso made her sad one day and she tried to leave, but I wouldn't let her go. 
- [Tia](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tia) - Super cute teapot elephant. Don't tell Apple, but she's my favorite islander so far. So friendly and so darn cute!!!
- [Eugene](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Eugene) - 50's greaser Koala. He kind reminds me of the Fonz, but he lives in an office? He's a strange one, but he's totally grown on me. I think it was when Antonio gifted him a Dracula costume and he put it on... I literally laughed out loud, told him it was questionable, and he took it off embarassed. "It never happened!", he said, but now he walks around town all the time wearing it. He must never leave. 
- [Lobo](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Lobo) - A purple wolf, with a deep voice and yellow eyes. Poor guy seemed lost but content when we met on a mystery island, and well all I can say was it was love at first sight. He's an odd little wolf cookie, but plays some rockin' tunes and has a chess set on his table. (Not that I play, but still it's a good combo.) He too must never leave. ^.^
- [Zell](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Zell) - Spiffy big city gazelle/deer. He's one of my newer additions after one of my less than awesome earlier villager choices moved on. He's pretty cool. Pulls off his smug personality well, without being too overbearing about it. He's also got a pretty awesome look going in his house, with wallpaper looking like a big city and a grand piano next to candle light seating. 
- [Leopold](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Leopold) - A smug looking lion... that seems to live in a school room. He seemed cool at first, but now he seems too good for the rest of us and I just think he's a bit weird. He was my first campsite visitor and I wish I had just let him continue on his journey.
- [Kitt](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Kitt) - A cute little kangaroo with a joey in her pouch. She's a pretty average sort, nothing too interesting about her really. A kinda take her or leaver her addition to my island.
- [Jitters](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Jitters) - Jitters popped into my campsite one day, and after chatting with him a bit asked to stay. That was pretty awesome, as it got one of my earlier choices, Alfonso, who had started to annoy me off the island. However, I'm not super excited about Jitters either, but maybe he'll be easier to have move on.
