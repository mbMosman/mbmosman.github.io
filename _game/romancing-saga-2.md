I saw it pop up on sale in the Nintendo store on sale, and remembering that I liked an earlier SaGa game on PS2 thought why not! It's __*SO*__ old school JRPG and a bit different than the SaGa game I remembered (Frontier 2 I think?), but it's been really cool to revisit something like this. The game play here is rather non-linear and open, and you play as a series of heirs to the throne. It's a pretty cool idea and I'm really getting into it. 

> The Emperor or Empress of Avalon begins the game as King Leon and later plays as his various heirs down through the game years. Leon hands his kingdom over to his son, Gerard. At the end of Gerard's reign, the player is able to choose his or her own successor and pass on Gerard's abilities to them. At the end of each generation, he or she will be given a choice of four heirs. Their identity is based on a combination of chance and anyone whom the player has assisted or allied within in a past generation.
