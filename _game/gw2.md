I've got a bit of a history with Guild Wars, which biases me a little bit. I mean any game that says I'm a God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals is going to win me over. I've played GW2, since it's release in 2012 and its predecessor Guild Wars for 5-6 years as well. I'm very much a fan of the franchise, and enjoy the game for it's storytelling and world as much as game play itself. I'm not much for the PvP aspect of the game, but the idea of the WvW is kinda cool. It's fun to run with the zerg, but it also gets old pretty fast too. I'm much more in it for the PvE game and generally treat it more as a single-player game these days unless I have friends on.

It's now free to play the base GW2 game, but the expansion areas are still purchase only. I've enjoyed both Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire (PoF) a lot. Access to mounts from PoF makes a __huge__ difference in overall game enjoyment, especially in HoT which introduced *gliding* and the maps begin to focus more on vertical terrain levels.

If you join and want to play together, friend me as the Sylvari Ranger, Myrsine.
