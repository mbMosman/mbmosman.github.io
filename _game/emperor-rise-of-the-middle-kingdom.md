This is an oldie, but I've loved games like this forever & it seems they just can't make games like this anymore... Sure there are city builders of a sort, but it seems that I love them more as they used to be than as they seem to be today. I must say too that there is more game play packed into this one game's campaigns than in 2-3 modern game releases. I've spent a lot of time in this game, and I don't think I ever made it through the entire set of campaigns. That's now my goal, to make my way through it all. 

Current Campaign Progress (Normal Difficulty)

- Xia Dynasty - Conquered w/ no real difficulty... Nice tutorial!
- Shang Dynasty - Conquered! The re-visit to Yin made for some challenges, as I built mainly to win the initial scenario.
- Zhou - 1/2 way as of 06/13/2019. The desert city of Yulin was a good challenge. Starting to see that I could be *a lot* more efficient. I play more to build the city than to win. That caused that scenario to take significantly more time and restarts to find victory. Hopefully the lesson learned will pay off for the next city.
