I noticed that there was going to be a new Settler's game out later this year, and got a little excited. Funny thing is they were never really my favorite games, because I kinda stink at playing most RTS type games. I wanna enjoy the ambiance and smell the flowers, then some neighboring group swings in and kicks my ass. UGH! 

Still I've always had a soft spot for these games in particular, as they are just kinda cute too. So I decided to give and and give it a go. If things work out well, maybe Martin and I can local multiplayer it, even though we have a bad history of getting that to work.
