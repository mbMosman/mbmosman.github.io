So, I can't recall how I ended up reading the first of these, but I did and it was pretty funny and cute. The main characters are from different worlds with the rich & well to do businessman Takane matched up with the very average HS girl Hana. They're basically tossing insults and such back and forth, stubbornly trying not to let the other score any wins, while of course finding they like each other more than they may want to admit. 

There's quite the age gap between the two, I think they put Takane at 22 (or 20-something), while Hana is 16. Things are far from a serious romance at the start, but it's hard to say where it all will go. If that's an issue, don't read it. Takane's not the only older guy, and while they seem to be respecting the girls' youth, the premise can be bothersome even for me at times. It's also pretty hard to ignore, as it is brought up a lot in conversation and circumstance.

The series is still on-going, with a volume released about every 2 months. This is on my library list, it's cute, but not enough to invest in and put on my own shelf.
