This is another of my favorties, despite being something of a random pick initially. It's an interesting fantasy/romance with a bit of a love-triangle brewing between the heroine Asahi, the Water Dragon God - who she's supposed to marry but hasn't, and Subaru who is her childhood friend.

I'm really impressed with both the story & the art. I'm also just fascinated by the character of the Water Dragon God, who doesn't seem to quite get anything human, particularly emotions. The author has done a great job with the characters and story. <3
