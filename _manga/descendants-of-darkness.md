I started to read this as Mizuho Kusanagi, author of [Yona of the Dawn](/manga/yona-of-the-dawn.html), used to work for her, and wanted to see if or how it might have impacted her work. 

I've been dying to get started reading this series for several weeks now. I put a hold on them just before volume 1 was due to be returned to the library. Volumes 2, 3, & 4 showed up quite promptly, but not volume 1... It is still out and overdue. With my luck it is probably lost. So I gave in and starting with volume 2, and for the most part was able to sort things out...

After finishin volumes 2, 3, & 4, I decided to drop this series. (If I hadn't had all three books sitting here, I probably would have bailed without finishing 3.) It was a little darker than I was willing to go in for, and was more supernatural mystery / crime fighting than I hoped. On the whole, I really wasn't digging the storylines or the characters. 

It was also just too dark in places. I expected death, I mean they're working for some underworld ministry, but this is gorey, ugly death. Volume 2, with the dancer who died peacefully at the end and the story of the cursed violin was OK. I could handle that. Volumes 3 and 4 however are full of intentionally cruel murder and scandal. It's just not my thing.

There's also a lot of boy-love undertones and some overt bits, which would bother me a lot less if it weren't portrayed as abusive and wrong. I suppose that is a mark of the time to some extent as this was originally written in the late 90's, but it still bothers me to see it. Between Dr. Muraki in the last volume and the Catholic boy's school murders in this one, it's just too much a theme for me to want to continue with these stories. Oddly enough in the side notes, Matsushita says something along the lines of "I write what I like, if you don't like it read something else", and so I shall.
