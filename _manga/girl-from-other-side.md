Summary: 

> In a land far away, there were two kingdoms: the Outside, where twisted beasts roamed that could curse with a touch, and the Inside, where humans lived in safety and peace. The girl and the beast should never have met, but when they do, a quiet fairytale begins. 

Thoughts:

The art is dark, but has a sense of sweetness to it. It is beautifully drawn. One volume in, the story itself is both sweet and dark as well. I'm already curious what else Nagabe has done.
