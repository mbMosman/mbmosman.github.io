> With the help of a magical pair of sneakers, a young sorceress transforms into an adult and sets out on magical adventures full of wonder and danger! Ran Uruma can’t wait to grow up and become a sorceress like her mother, so with the help of a magical pair of sneakers, she transforms into an adult and sets off! Her father and older brother Jin try to keep her home safe, but Ran is determined to advance her powers and have adventures of her own!

So, there's some themes here that I'm not sure what to make of, beginning with a little girl (in elementary school) who's shoes turn her into a busty adult woman. There's an older man of questionable repute who's fallen for her not knowing she's really a kid, and a kid in school who's also enamoured with her and knows she can magically grow up. There's more nudity than I expected, but so it's not tasteless... 

The format of this manga seems to be more episodic than not, but as we get into volume 3, the plot thickens with a supernatural war between the sorceresses and some bugs sealed behind a door, which of course escape at the end of volume 4, adding mahem to the whole scene. Not sure where this is going, but I am captivated and thoroughly entertained.
