OK, so I'm just not going to make any excuses for this at all. This is my #1 favorite manga series. This is a bold say, because there are others that I adore, but this is really, hands down my favorite. So a fair question is why?

Yona is a pretty awesome heroine. If you missed it, I was Yona for Halloween.

She's a fluffy princess at the start, but fear not, it doesn't last very long. Her world is hugely shook up in the first few volumes with the murder of her father by Su-won who she has grown up with, adores, and wants to marry. She flees the palace, running for her life, and despite the shock, emotions, and having never left the palace before, she grows and adapts. She doesn't let others carry her through. Also, despite her precarious position, she doesn't abandon her people. She wants to learn about her people and make their lives better.

But I'd be remiss in not mentioning Hak, a.k.a the Thunderbeast.

He's just plain awesome. If I could bring to life an anime character for a night, well... I'd say it'd be Hak, but he'd only be interested in Yona. Sigh. 

Anyhow, there's interesting goings on between Yona, Hak, & Su-won. They've all known each other as kids (played back a bit in Vol. 11), and it's interesting to see how their relationships have evolved as they've gotten older. Hak's feelings for Yona have clearly changed. Yona is mostly oblivious to this, though the others aren't. It's interesting to watch as Yona questions her own feeling towards Su-won and Hak, and to wonder where this will all lead.

The series is still on-going, with a volume released about every 2 months. It's one of the few that I have committed to adding into my own little manga library, so I'd like to think that backs up my praise.
