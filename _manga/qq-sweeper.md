This is a 3 volume series, which ended and was picked up again as [Queens Quality](/manga/queens-quality.html).

This sounded so amazingly cheesy:

> Kyutaro Horikita, the tall, dark and handsome cleaning expert of Kurokado High, is about to meet a sleeping maiden at the school: transfer student Fumi Nishioka! Fumi’s going to learn how to rid the school of nasty spirits with Kyutaro’s help, and her heart will surprisingly be “cleansed” too…!

I was really skeptical picking it up, but since it was from the author of Dengeki Daisy (which I adored), I thought I'd give it a go and see if I enjoyed it just as much. Oddly enough, I did! While the cleaning and sweeping is just a little odd, the heroine and her "Cinderella dream" is rather annoyingly endearing.

I don't know if it's really *horror*, but there are some dark themes and definitely __bugs__.
