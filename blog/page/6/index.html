          <p>Since we couldn’t get everyone together for an official graduation ceremony, we did it over Zoom. So here’s our Zoom graduation picture.</p>

<p><img alt="Dijkstra Zoom graduation pic" src="/assets/2020/06/12/DijkstraGraduation-0d03cc5376c0f48ade91529e0d489bc0085d18c92f159998c81ce41b2d08e64f.jpg" /></p>

<p>I delivered their graduation certificates to the Gold Medal Park in Minneapolis, near the Prime campus, Friday morning and we cheated a bit for this park picture. One of us was out of town, but we got the others together for a little bit of farewell fun.</p>

<p><img alt="Most of Dijkstra at the park" src="/assets/2020/06/12/Dijkstra-Park-596adf6c0d4400ff71cdb2fd8d7dfcb70505ceb692f1b1bc30ad9e1a9a2d2117.jpg" /></p>

<p>I had a bit of an adventure on the way back as my tire blew out on the way home.</p>

<p><img alt="The blown-out tire" src="/assets/2020/06/12/blown-out-tire-77528ed96c3cba6d8a7253ed240936b67047c6696fcd163fb12f73c5f14dd6ca.jpg" /></p>

<p>It happened on the highway, which was highly inconvenient as I didn’t realize at first what happened. Fortunately I got pulled off and had an amazing gentleman and his son offer to help me out putting on the spare. I really appreciated it as it was about 1:30, and I still needed to get home in time for the Zoom graduation starting at 3. We got it done in no time and he also pointed me to the closest Discount Tire to get a new one. Also great as I didn’t feel comfortable getting back on the highway with the little spare. They got me a new tire and I managed to scoot into graduation just a wee bit late - they stalled a bit for me. It’s these little things that make me remeber the world isn’t such a bad place after all. Woot!</p>

<p>The day ended on a bit of a sad note however as Martin’s dad passed away. We may not be married now, but they’ve been my family for the last 11 years, and a piece of paper does little to erase the feelings I’ve developed for them over the years.</p>

            <p>So it's June... Not sure how that happened, but this starts the 12th week that I've been more or less entirely at home. Things of late have been pretty crazy with the protests, riots & curfews that have filled the cities since the [death of George Floyd at the hands of Mpls Police.</p>

          <div> 
            <p>The cabinets are really in now. I'm happy that work at least is all done! I can move my dishes and pantry things back into the kitchen and now I have more space to store things! Woot!</p>

          <div> 
            <p>In an attempt to plan for some yummy food that is just as good without being rewarmed for leftovers, I decided today would be grilling day. So I woke up and kicked off the Green Egg to smoke a beef brisket. The yummy smells could keep me motivated through some more work in the kitchen. Woot! ^.^</p>

          <div> 
            <p>So, the cabinet install was scheduled for the Tuesday & Wednesday following Memorial Day. That means the holiday weekend was really kitchen tear-out and repair weekend for me.</p>

          <div> 
            <p>I have a new beauty product obsession - these amazing Lapcos Korean sheet masks from Costo. I am not really one for beauty products, but I've been super stressed and I was all in for a way to kick back and relax. I was a bit skeptical, but it was so amazing. It was cool and refreshing, and I could just feel the stress melting away.</p>
