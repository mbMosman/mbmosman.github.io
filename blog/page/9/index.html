          <p>I feel like time just keeps sneaking by me. It doesn’t help that I’ve been so busy at work and home, or that I’ve just been so generally stressed out and frazzled. But the change from one month to the next always makes me realize that passage of time in a way that the day to day doesn’t.</p>

<p>I was sick for the better part of the weekend. I woke up Thursday feeling stuffy and with a bit of a sore throat, but managed to pull it all together with some cold meds and made it through the day. I really wanted to see my current class get their group project scope documents together and ready for their clients, but I also had my first online classes with the new upcoming cohort. It made for a later night, but that also allowed me to see some of my Atbash &amp; Menkar alumni who are now mentoring. Woot!</p>

<p>By bedtime though, I was really feeling the cold coming on, but the kitties were determined to help me stay warm and feel better.</p>

<p><img alt="Kyo and Fred keeping me warm." src="/assets/2020/02/02/burried-in-cat-5fa2da5973bc134f4bfaf8ab64858bd9169e1b2995d24ea1bcae4046a9de9edb.jpg" /></p>

<p>I ended up home sick Friday. I slept pretty well overnight, thanks to some NyQuil, but had trouble getting back to sleep after feeding the cats in the morning. So I just sat on the couch, enjoying the daylight, and watching the light snow fall out the window. It was so pretty out there… the falling snow doesn’t really come through in the pictures though.</p>

<p><img alt="Frontyard in the snow." src="/assets/2020/02/02/frontyard-fb6010889359cfc3b627f9a2e9b575bd83f8aba07d1f0eb190c83498bcc0b8b7.jpg" /></p>

<p>I slept for most of Friday afternoon, watched the rest of <a href="/vizmedia/the-dragon-prince">The Dragon Prince</a> in the evening, and then went back to bed.</p>

<p>I managed to sleep in a bit on Saturday, then the cats roused me for breakfast by puking on the bed. Ugh… Those were my new sheets, cat!!! So I ended up doing laundry too.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we got our monthly Prime cat litter delivery, and with it came a new kitty surprise - silvervine sticks. It is supposed to work much like catnip, but it gives them something more substantial to chew on. It also doesn’t make quite the same mess all over the floor. ^.^  They seemed to dig it, but it didn’t quite get them to the same levels of kitty-high.</p>

<p>Kyo was wisely posessive of his stick.

<p>Fred wasn’t as careful and let it roll out of reach.

<p>Of course that meant Abby moved in. Notice she brought hers over and now has two.

<p>I heard the sticks rolling around on the floor all night, so they clearly had fun with it. Three paws up?</p>

<p>That brings me to Sunday morning which I started with blueberry pancakes for breakfast - pretty good, but slightly burnt. Martin was the pancake king. I guess I’ll learn…</p>

<p>The kitties have been enjoying the cat litter delivery box. I was fortunate enough to catch the brief moment where it housed both Abby <strong><em>and</em></strong> Fred.</p>

<p><img alt="Abby and Fred in an amazon box." src="/assets/2020/02/02/abby-fred-box-14cf334589c90951758acba7cbc5966c517db16f3552b9a3958cae456995ab0e.jpg" /></p>

<p>I’ve been watching the flurry of birds at the bird feeder while sipping some tea. It’s been quite the show this morning. We’ve had a pair of cardinals, a pair of nuthaches, some cute little things with red chests that I looked up once and forgot, some similar ones with brownish-yellow chests, and a right proper storm of chicadees. Not to mention the pair of squirrls that keep racing across the tree then back across the deck and out into the yard. I do love this place for that.</p>

<p>I’ve been stalling here with blog updates. Somehow it’s after noon already! I said I was going to work on my taxes today, but it looks rather glorious outside…</p>

            <p>A while ago I mentioned Martin's been staying at his dad's place... Well, it's more than that. He's moved back in there, and we've decided to move ahead with making this split official. I haven't wanted to make our private lives public, so I'm not going to hash out all our woes here. However I'm also not going to try to hide this or pretend it isn't happening anymore either.</p>

            <p>I was invited out to see the latest Star Wars movie, *The Rise of Skywalker* over the weekend, which put me into a bit of a bind. I wanted to go, __*but*__ I hadn't seen the previous movie and barely remembered the first of the trilogy. So I resolved to catch myself up in time to go and be somewhat up to date on things. Glad I did, but what a mess!</p>
