          <p>After temperatures dropped for the last week, it’s finally windows open again. Got to enjoy some dinner on the deck. Woot! Do I want to know how many weeks we’ve been at home now? ( It’s 9 weeks now I think… )</p>

<p>There were a lot of great things about this week. First, the kitchen cabinets came. The whole delivery thing was a bit more of a mess than I would have liked, but they are here now. Finally. Hanging out in my garage waiting patiently for someone to come unbox and check them out.</p>

<p>Next, up, my current Dijkstra cohort at Prime presented their solo projects and they absolutely rocked them. Amazing work all around. They’re really rolling with this remote work world we’ve found ourselves in. So very proud of all their efforts and the awesome payoff. Also, special thanks to Kris who ran the presentations while I was waiting for the cabinets to show. Also on the work front, we had a guest lecturer from our Kansas City campus, something that probably wouldn’t have happened before Covid sent us remote.</p>

<p>Last but not least, my mortgage refinance finally closed, freeing Martin from the loan and getting me a sweet low rate. I’ve now got a 20 year vs the 30 year we had earlier with only about $70 more on the payment per month. I’m quite pleased by that. House paid before retirement! Yes!!! On top of the sweet deal, the process was also super quick. They’re nowing having us review the documents in advance, and then going in for final signatures. It took maybe 15 minutes in the office. Woot! That process improvement really needs to remain in place.</p>

            <p>Well, I finally feel like Spring is really here! The weather the last few days has been great, and finally today I got out to really enjoy it. Finished up work and went out to kick back in the hammock.</p>

          <div> 
            <p>I've been on a music kick lately, specifically a JPop kick, after seeing that Miyavi released a new album *Holy Nights* on 4/22. Spent some time on YouTube watching videos, and well one thing lead to another, and I was off on a spiral of discovery...</p>

          <div> 
            <p>WOOT!!! At long last, the Final Fantasy VII Remake is in my hands! It's been years now since I initially pre-ordered this. I have waited so long to play it. Stay at home? Sure, I can do that!</p>

          <div> 
            <p>So this now our 4th week stay at home and remote work. Woot? I'm happy that things aren't worse than they are, but what a state of the world. I'm glad that at least April has brought us some nice weather, but it seems that it's windows open one day and freezing rain the next here. Boo!</p>

          <div> 
            <p>I've been hanging in there through 2 weeks of remote work, and it's certainly had its ups and downs. It takes a little getting used to, though I think we've been amazingly successful teaching remotely. Woot! I've also got some solid home progress to share.</p>
