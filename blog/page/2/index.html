          <p>I haven’t updated in a while, so I guess I should catch up on some things…</p>

<p>It was called out that not only have I not updated the blog in a while, but I sounded a bit down and sad. Well, I was… I’m not sure that I saw it coming either. The last month or two now has been really rough. I’m not really at a point to process that all here on the blog, but it’s been busy and there’s been more than an average amount of stress of late.</p>

<p>My cohort’s graduation, and the start of the next cohort here today, gives me a chance to kinda start over in the work world. It also gives a nice opportunity to take some time off. Woot! Looking forward to taking Wed-Fri off for a super long weekend. Hopefully that will give me some time to de-stress and process some of the things that I haven’t really had time to think through yet.</p>

<p>I’m now thinking pretty seriously about selling my house and at least for the short-term getting an apartment in or near downtown St. Paul again. I want to finish up a little more of the work we started on the house before I put it up for sale. Specifically I want to spiffy up the upstairs bathroom a bit, as it really stands out as crappy right now. Then, I need to finish the trim upstairs in the kitchen &amp; bath and likely touch-up some of the paint in a few other places.</p>

<p>The basement needs a lot more love, so I really need to think about how much to do there. I need to do something for the flooring and the fireplace. There’s also a lot of trim work that needs done. I try not to think about the bathroom, but it’s the big sore spot right now as it’s totally torn out. Ugh…</p>

<p>Anyhow, the thought is that I’ll get started on that over the upcoming time off. We’ll see I guess. In the mean time, I’m enjoying some awesome egg rolls from I WOK in Burnsville via Door Dash. Woot! Sometimes it’s the little things in life that matter, and these egg rolls rock. They’re also <em>HUGE</em>.</p>

            <p>One of my students suggested, Fitness Boxing on the Switch, and since it had a free demo out for the new version, I decided to give it a go. I'm really enjoying it! It's a hell of a work out for me, but I've got a cute trainer I can play dress up with so I think that's supposed to make the pain worth it...</p>
