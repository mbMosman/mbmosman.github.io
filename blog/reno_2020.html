  In 2020, *our* forever home became just *my* home with my divorce. I'm not really sure about long term plans for *forever* anymore, but I've got too much vested here to just walk away from it, even though it's a huge house for just me and the cats. For now, the project work goes on. After all, what else can it do?

  The year started with work in the basement to clean things up, put in a new subfloor, new heaters, and paint. Then with Spring the work in the kitchen began.
