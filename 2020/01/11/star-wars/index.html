  <h1 class="post-title">Catching upn on Star War & Netflix</h1>
  <time datetime="2020-01-11T00:00:00-06:00" class="post-date">11 Jan 2020</time>
  <p>I was invited out to see the latest Star Wars movie, <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> over the weekend, which put me into a bit of a bind. I wanted to go, <strong><em>but</em></strong> I hadn’t seen the previous movie and barely remembered the first of the trilogy. So I resolved to catch myself up in time to go and be somewhat up to date on things. Glad I did, but what a mess!</p>

<p>I had mostly resolved myself to resubscribe to Netflix a week or so ago, but I never actually got around to it. This seemed like the perfect excuse, so I finally resubscribed. It’s been years… Anyhow Christy fixed me up with a list of things that I should watch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dragon Prince</li>
  <li>The Witcher</li>
  <li>Altered Carbon</li>
  <li>Jonathon Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</li>
  <li>Stranger Things</li>
  <li>Violet Evergarden</li>
  <li>Kuromukuro</li>
</ul>

<p>Woot! I certainly won’t be without media to watch for a while. However it didn’t take long to discover that the only Star Wars left on Netflix was Solo. Ugh! (I did end up watching that too, and it was better than I thought, but left a bit to be desired.)</p>

<p>So Disney’s moving all their stuff - which includes Star Wars &amp; Marvel - to their own Disney+ channel. Many, but not all, things have already moved. I’m not sold on paying for this monthly, as I doubt I’d be watching this stuff on a regular basis, but I figured I could at least give it at trial run. Who knows, maybe I’ll change my mind. Besides, it was that or buy/rent it from Amazon at almost the same price, but without the other things.</p>

<p>So sign-up I did. I watched <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> as well as <em>The Mandalorian</em>, which I enjoyed <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> more. I managed to finish both with time to spare before the movie Saturday night. I also poked a little at some of the other things there Sunday, and ended up watching something about the Maya from National Geographic &amp; <em>Brave</em> which I hadn’t seen before either. While it there is no shortage of Disney stuff, I just couldn’t see myself watching anything else, so I cancelled it Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Back to the movie though. We went to the Mall of America to see it and I must say that I was shocked by the renovations to the theater there. The concession area totally made me feel like I was in some fancy Disney shop. There was a whole array of things to eat and drink, not just popcorn, candy, &amp; soda. There were healthier options too like fruit &amp; cheese &amp; juice. There was also a pizza place, with what looked like some really nice fresh baked, made to order pizza. The theater itself was really nice too, with a lot fewer seats. These were recliners with little tables attached for your snacks. They were huge. I feel like two of me could have fit in my seat. It made me think I might actually be missing out by not going to the theater. Unbelievable!</p>
