    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I have spent way too much time in this game lately. The scenarios are probably <em>not</em> the best place to learn the ropes, but there wasn’t a tutorial outside of this so off I went. It isn’t entirely intuitive, and it took a bit of digging to even learn what my problems were much less how to fix them. It does help you with a few things initially, but leaves a lot unexplained, even in the <em>help</em> information.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trains</li>
  <li>Sim Game</li>
  <li>Options for realism or <em>cheats</em> on the rail lines</li>
  <li>Relatively intuitive status information</li>
</ul>

<p>I love sim games and trains, so this hits some sweet spots that make me a little more forgiving. It’s kinda fun to sort out how to supply cities and make them grow, but once you get things figured out it also feels a little to easy. I haven’t tried adjusting difficulty, but many of the options are also disabled for the campaign mode anyhow. I haven’t tried the <em>cheat</em> to let trains pass each other on the same line, but I like that the option is there for those that don’t want to try and sort out the track switching nightmare mentioned below.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tutorial (if one can call it that) leaves <strong>a lot</strong> out</li>
  <li>Balance feels off, once you sort things out it’s kinda easy</li>
  <li>Track switching nightmare in <em>realistic</em> mode</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish that there was a way to add automatic track switching to a station without buldozing it and building a new, longer one. The track switching at the stations is a bit of a nightmare. I assumed that if I put in my own switches, the trains would be smart enough to go to an open station. Then I realized that no matter what, all the trains were going to the first track. That seemed to defeat the purpose of the larger station with multiple tracks.</p>

<p>Accidentally, two very full game days in and well into the 3rd campaign, I bumped into a place to assign a track for an individual train. Unfortunately, though there isn’t a way to really schedule when trains arrive, so you might have 3 trains show up for track 2 all at the same time, but track 1 is empty. <strong>ARGH!!!</strong> This can help, but because routes are differnt lengths and trains may wait for cargo, this is not really helpful, or realistic.</p>

<p>There is a station upgrade for this issue, but it requires (or so it appears to me) that you entirely tear down the station to build the upgrade. This messes up all the trains going to that station, and also causes a mess of problems for the rail lines as buldozing them can destroy long stretches up to a switch or supply tower. <strong>ARGH!!!</strong> This new station is also much longer, so it may not fit into the old design, or in some cases where the city is near the coast or a river, it may not fit at all. <strong>ARGH!!!</strong></p>

<h3 id="overall-take">Overall take</h3>

<p>I like it, but it’s frustrating. I’ll probably finish out the scenarios and then only come back to it if I really want a train fix. As a resource management game or empire builder it really isn’t very satisfying. Resources are plentiful, I had no trouble making money, and the AI competition really doesn’t seem to hinder things much.</p>
