    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I’ve got a bit of a history with Guild Wars, which biases me a little bit. I mean any game that says I’m a God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals is going to win me over. I’ve played GW2, since it’s release in 2012 and its predecessor Guild Wars for 5-6 years as well. I’m very much a fan of the franchise, and enjoy the game for it’s storytelling and world as much as game play itself. I’m not much for the PvP aspect of the game, but the idea of the WvW is kinda cool. It’s fun to run with the zerg, but it also gets old pretty fast too. I’m much more in it for the PvE game and generally treat it more as a single-player game these days unless I have friends on.</p>

<p>It’s now free to play the base GW2 game, but the expansion areas are still purchase only. I’ve enjoyed both Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire (PoF) a lot. Access to mounts from PoF makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference in overall game enjoyment, especially in HoT which introduced <em>gliding</em> and the maps begin to focus more on vertical terrain levels.</p>

<p>If you join and want to play together, you can friend me as the Sylvari Ranger, Myrsine.</p>

<h3 id="latest-status">Latest Status:</h3>

<p>I’ve really been enjoying my time in GW2 a lot lately. There has recently been a new release of their Living World content which continues their story content, and I think this latest release has been particularly good. We’ve had a lot of <em>defeat the big bad</em> as the focus of the content, while some potentially interesting under currents have taken 2nd place to the fight. This time it feels like those under currents are put more front and center, and the change in the content feel is rather gripping.</p>

<p>Historically I’ve rarely played through their Living World content more than once or twice, if more than that it’s been for some key loot reward. I’ve taken 5 characters through the first two episodes of this new content at this point, and intend to keep rolling through my others. Not only is the story line cool, but the new maps are kinda fun. It’s re-kindled my sense of joy for the game, and even has me revisiting some of the older content to <em>complete</em> it. Woot!</p>
