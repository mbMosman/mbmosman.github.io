    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>This is a pretty cute game. The idea is kinda neat in that you have vikings that may respawn across you mission building adventures, and they are earning their way to their eternal rewards in Valhalla. I like that the game has a tutorial to help ease you into it, as there’s a good bit of complexity. However I think the tutorial could do a bit more to help you out getting started. The first tier is <em>*super*</em> basic, but the next few teirs make some really big leaps without explaining all the details.</p>

<p>A little trial and erroring is fine, since it’s pretty forgiving at first. But it’s not necessarily clearly obvious when things aren’t going well. It took me a while to realize that my Tool Maker wasn’t could have carriers to get resources. Then it took a while to realize why they wouldn’t pick up ones sitting clearly right there on the map - they were out of the building’s range.  When the tutorial says place the fishing hut near the water, that isn’t quite the same thing to me as place it near a <em>beach</em>, and not what I later realized was a cliff edge over the ocean.</p>

<p>I appreciate the thought of the tutorial, but it could definitely stand some better pacing and a better balance of detailed explaination along side trial and error exploration of the game mechanics. Unfortunately I probably won’t come back to this game because of it. There are a lot of similarities to the Settlers games here, and there is less barrier to entry there.</p>

<p>The other part of the game that is awkward is the visual presentation. You can zoom in or out, but can’t spin the map. That’s part of the reason I didn’t realize there was a beach vs ocean cliff at first. For placing buildings, I also didn’t come across a way to rotate them, so if I want a stone cutter and quary next to each other, it’s a short walk if they go side by side, but if it is a vertical arrangement they have to walk around the building vs across the path.</p>

<p>Cool idea, but not sold on the delivery.</p>
