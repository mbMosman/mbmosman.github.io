title: Menkar 6 Month Reunion
---

It's been 6 months since my Menkarians graduated from [Prime](https://primeacademy.io/) back in August of last year. To celebrate, they planned a little reunion at [Surly](https://surlybrewing.com/destination-brewery/) this afternoon. It was __so much fun__ to see them again. 

While we didn't get everyone to come, there was an amazing turn out!

They're all so amazing! I'm so very proud of them! It's so cool to hear them talking about their jobs and the things they are doing in their post-Prime life. I __so__ love my job. It's always amazing to me to watch the transformation of our students into Software Developers, but to listen to them months after graduation and hear the buzz of techie conversation as they chat about work is just awesome!
