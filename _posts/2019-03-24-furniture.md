Going into this weekend, I was pretty fixated on getting the rest of the floors done. However, really, all I wanted was to get some furniture upstairs and feel like we've got an actual home. So we switched gears a little, got the painting done and moved in some furniture.

Saturday was painting day, starting with the ceiling, which did not want to be painted. It's popcorned, and the roller peeled off chunks of it in sections. Total pain!!! In some places I managed to squish it back into place, but there are two spots where huge chunks just peeled right off. Martin says it looks fine, but my eyes always seem to go right to that spot. Argh! Maybe we can popcorn patch it and try painting it again, but that does seem like an awful lot of trouble...

I was pretty tired after finishing the ceiling, but then I managed to edge the dining room & living room along the top of the ceiling and did the corners too. Martin saved me at that point and got the big roller out to paint the walls. The second coat went up Sunday before we met Dave for another Sunday Snuffy's lunch. 

We came home Sunday and finished painting trim and got the floors cleaned up - no more paint dribbles. We will still need to get the trim cut and put along the floor, doors, and windows, but Martin said he could work around that if we wanted to move some furniture upstairs. I *really* wanted to get that table moved in, so we did. We moved the dining room table & our display cases (sitting on each side of the slider) all up into the dining room. We also pulled the TV upstairs, maybe we will get that hung on the wall later this week too. It'd be great to have anime night again!

I'm so excited to have a cozy living space again! 

Martin has also been working on built-in drawers and cabinet space for our hallway closet. I don't have pictures yet, but he finished up the drawers this weekend and built the cabinet shells earlier in the week. He's working on painting and then a front-piece for it, but hopefully that will also be done this week.

Martin's been working hard on his desk. It's looking good! Same style as mine, butcher-block style from scrap wood, but his is stained lighter. I believe he used *Danish Oil*.

That got me motivated to finally get my main desk area stained too. It's also looking good. I've stained it to match the flooring, so it's much darker. I really like the patterns in the wood though. Super awesome! I never imagined a scrap-wood desk could turn out so well!
