My first Prime cohort, Gacrux, graduated today.

What an emotional day... I'm so excited for them...

But it's so hard knowing they won't be back in my classroom on Monday. It's been an amazing journey and we've had so much fun together. I'm going to look forward to that first Gacrux reunion happy hour.

May the 4th be with them, always!
