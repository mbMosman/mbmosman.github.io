title: Settling In
---

Since we unloaded most stuff into the garage, today was spent moving stuff into the family room down stairs, our storage area for all our stuff while we rip up the upstairs floors. Just say no to carpet! We also got started with the carpet tear out, but didn't get past the master bedroom. 

The kitties are settling in nicely, though they were somewhat distressed by the visitors - radon system install & flooring delivery - and all the moving noise. When it was quiet they were happy to pop out of hiding and sit on the couch with us, our one piece of upstairs furniture. I broke out the catnip for a bit in the afternoon and that got their attention. They were having a blast rolling around on the carpet and pulling themselves across it with their claws. They haven't lived in a carpeted place, so I imagine the floor for them is like a room sized cat tree.

The flooring was delivered tonight, all 3500 lbs of it. There are 45 boxes of bamboo flooring sitting in the dining room now, acclimating to our lovely abode and waiting patiently to be installed. We were thinking it needed to sit for 2-3 days, but the delivery guy from the store suggested more like 2 weeks. I'm not sure I have that much patience, but we certainly have enough other work with the carpet & trim tear out and the painting to keep us busy while we wait a bit.
