preview: What?! A blizzard in April? Where do I live? Minnesota?!

So as I'm sure you've all heard we've got more exciting weather happening here this week in MN. Fortunately the really nasty stuff is further west and north of the Twin Cities area where we are, but this isn't exactly fun either. I don't think snow was what they had in mind when they said "April showers bring May flowers."

We called it a WFH (work from home) day for class. No need for any usafe travel in these messy conditions and public schools were cancelled too, so this worked out well for parents. The students spent the day working on a project together remotely and meeting with me one-on-one online. Remote project work is definitely a tech job thing, so I think it was actually a cool experience for the students to have.

Today is also Martin's birthday, but our dinner plans got cancelled since no one wanted to get out and drive in all of this mess. It hailed on me as I was snow shoveling the driveway and I'm pretty sure I also heard the infamous __thunder snow__. Woot?
