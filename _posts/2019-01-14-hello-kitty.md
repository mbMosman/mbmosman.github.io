<strong>Woot! My Hello Kitty Shinkansen arrived from Japan today!!!</strong>

Yes, so I am a bit of a model train geek. It hasn't had a lot of opportunity yet to show itself, but with our upcoming move, Martin and I are planning to officially have a train room. So expect to see more of the model train love manifesting as we fix things up over the next year. 

In the mean time, please check out the awesomeness of my newest addition, the JR 500 Sanyo Shinkansen (Hello Kitty).

It's pretty small in N scale. But it looks *huge* compared to my itty-bitty little Z scale, Shinkansen 500 Type EVA.

The box is of course super cute...

I'm learning Japanese:
  - ヘローキティ is Hello Kitty
  - 山陽 is Sanrio
  - 新幹線 is Shinkansen
  - 8個セット means 8 piece set
  - JR西日本 means JR West (I can't sort out the rest of the kanji following to translate... Help me?)
  - トミックス is TOMIX, or you might also see トミーテック TOMYTEC

The back of the box shows the stops with Hello Kitty featuring something from that area:
  - a black shell for the great lake in Shimane
  - an apple for Tottori
  - a strawberry for Fukuoka
  - bread for Hyogo which is known for it's bakeries
  - Takoyaki (fried balls w/ octopus) from Osaka
  - Manju (Maple steamed buns) from Hiroshima
  - Globefish from Yamaguchi
  - Sweets (looks like a fruit parfait) from Okayama, known for the fairytale of Momotaro

This first video is a news story:

This video focuses more on just the train and a part of the journey, with some cool music:

We're super excited to see this up and running as it's our first Tomix model train. We've heard great things about them, but with everything packed up right now for our move, it'll be a bit before we can actually try it out. 

Our hero at [Model Trains Plus](https://www.modeltrainplus.net/), Nariichi Takayama, was also kind enough to send me some of the super cute Hello Kitty Shinkansen chopsticks too!
