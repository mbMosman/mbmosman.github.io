title: Duolingo 50 Day Streak!
---

Today I hit a 50 day streak of Japanese on [DuoLingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). Woot!!!

Thanks go out to Martin who got me off the habit of ignoring it over weekends and just having lots of little 5 day streaks throughout the week. On the otherhand, I am going to be __really__ unhappy when I forget some day and break this streak now. I guess I'll just have to not let that happen... somehow...

Yesterday, I forgot my phone at home and ended up using Duolingo on the web instead. I learned that some of the practice skills have an associated lesson (Tips & Notes) attached. These don't show up on the phone.

Phone - No Tips & Notes!

These Tips & Notes are super handy! Previously I was *guessing* (often incorrectly) at some of the reasons for things, because there was no explaination of the grammar or rules. I was surprised to discover that DuoLingo had this; it just was not visible on the phone!

If you only use DuoLingo through the phone app, I encourage you to check them out on the web. Now that I've found these, I'm planning to go back and review some of the earlier sections. I want to make sure I correctly understand the grammar rules & vocabulary usage. 

If you [DuoLingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) too, follow me and see if I can keep this streak going! I'd love to cheer you on in your language learning adventures as well. Find me on [DuoLingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) as __Mary233171__, where I'm learning Japanese along with an occassional review of some Russian.
