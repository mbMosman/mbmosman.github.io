__It's Valentine's Day!__

Martin suggested that we go out for some Kyoto Sushi dinner tonight, but I had a video class with my new cohort Atbash at 5:30, so I suggested we do a Valentine's Breakfast instead!

We went to Jensen's cafe, and as usual I was not disappointed. Their breakfast special was Nutella Crepes! I love hazlenut & chocolate and this also had raspberries, which is probably my favorite berry if not all time fruit. What could be more perfect?!

Martin has settled in on the Country Fried Steak as his favorite. It looks good too. I keep saying that I'm going to try that, as well as their biscuits and gravy, but then there is so much on the menu that looks good plus the specials!

Well, it was good we did the breakfast, as I ended up running late leaving. I just missing the last bus on my usual route home and had to hunt down another. It was 15 minutes out from when we wrapped up, so hung out a bit before heading to the bus. The weather didn't seem so bad - the snow had stopped in the afternoon - but it was really cold & the bus never showed up. The next one was 20 minutes later and while it came, it was a good 10 minutes behind as well. It was almost 8 PM before I got home. I still hadn't warmed up from my 30+ minute wait outside, so I just cranked up the heated matress pad and went to bed. Sigh...
