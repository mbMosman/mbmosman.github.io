Woot! My Vatti cohort graduated today! Wacka, wacka!  

This is the first cohort to graduate where I just haven't been able to see any of them in person __*ever!*__ (Too cold to do an outdoor park certificate hand-off this time!)

It's a little weird to think we've never met in person, but at the same time, it doesn't feel at all like these are people I don't know. We've had a great time together and have gotten to know each other so well despite being entirely remote.  

Got my stickers updated with the Vatti Pacman! Wacka, wacka!

I'm going to miss having y'all in class, but can't wait for that first happy hour!
