My beloved Fortunate cohort graduated today! Woot! 

We bravely gathered to celebrate graduation together had a little get together at the Crooked Pint downtown.

It's a little bitter-sweet as not only will I miss them dearly, but they will be my last Prime cohort. I've decided to leave as Prime heads back to campus this fall to continue working remotely.
