It's been a nice weekend, and I finally got myself outdoors to enjoy breakfast on the deck. The goal was to do some work on the blog, but I ended up not getting very far as it started raining on me before I finished my tea!

The crabapple is in full bloom now, and dropping little pink petals all over my deck and table.

I'm trying to be optimistic and keep thing running after finishing up all the bathroom work, but it's hard to stay motivated! I also think I'm kinda stalling cuz I'm not quite really ready to sell the house now that the weather is nicer. But things are busier again at work too, and it is __*hard*__ to work through the week and then also continue that through the weekend too.
