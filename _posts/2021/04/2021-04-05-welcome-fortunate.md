title:  Welcome Fortunate
preview: My 10th Prime cohort kicked off their full-time classroom work this week. Woot! I'm so excited! 10 is a big number!!! They feel extra special because we're all decimal based and all - not to mention they are called Fortunate!!!

My 10th Prime cohort kicked off their full-time classroom work this week. Woot! I'm so excited! 10 is a big number!!! They feel extra special because we're all decimal based and all - not to mention they are called Fortunate!!! There's 14 of them too... that I also feel is *fortunate*. ^.^ I'm going to have way too much fun with this crew.
