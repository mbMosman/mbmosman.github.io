title:  Bathroom Almost Finished
preview: So April is done, and the bathroom is mostly there. I managed to wrap-up the floor install, got the doors out & painted & back in. Then I decided to grout the floor too because I didn't like the way it felt on my bare feet. It was a lot of work, but I'm really happy with the outcome.

The vanity cabinet is looking top notch with the new floor.

Grouting the peel & stick tiles made the look AND feel much better!

The best part of this work was installing a bowed curtain rod for the shower. It has made a world of difference in my shower life. There is so much more space in there now & the curtain doesn't touch me while showering! Woot!!! I am SO happy with this and it took maybe 20 minutes to take the old one out and put the new one in.

Clearly the work is not __*all done*__ yet as there's no trim. I've been kinda in a bit of a procrastination slump and have been taking it a little easy over the last few cold & rainy weekends, but I'm determined to get this done over the next weekend or two.
