I've had a nice month or so off, but today I got off to a great new start with [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/). Looking forward to being part of their National Live Remote program. Woot for remote work & remote learning!

I'm pretty uncommitted to this blog at this point, so I'll be taking a hiatus as I sort out my new job, a new relationship, and all sorts of future plans.
