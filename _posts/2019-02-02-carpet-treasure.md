title: Carpet Treasures

Martin went to pick up his computer from his dad's place this morning, so that we could get at least get the wireless internet going and his computer up to keep track of our finances. While he was gone, I figured I'd get all the carpet pulled out of the other two bedrooms (our soon to be offices) to surprise him when he got back. Good to have goals, right?

Having been mostly on cleanup detail yesterday, I didn't realize just how filthy those carpets were. I wish now I had pictures of the piles of dirt that were there between the carpet and the pad! I couldn't wash my hands enough and ended up having to shower before I could sit down and rest peacefully. Anyhow dirt aside, it was kinda fun. I started in the back bedroom where I found a little paper package hidden under the carpet pad.
