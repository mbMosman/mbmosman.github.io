Martin went to pick up his computer from his dad's place this morning, so that we could get at least get the wireless internet going and his computer up to keep track of our finances. While he was gone, I figured I'd get all the carpet pulled out of the other two bedrooms (our soon to be offices) to surprise him when he got back. Good to have goals, right?

Having been mostly on cleanup detail yesterday, I didn't realize just how filthy those carpets were. I wish now I had pictures of the piles of dirt that were there between the carpet and the pad! I couldn't wash my hands enough and ended up having to shower before I could sit down and rest peacefully. Anyhow dirt aside, it was kinda fun. I started in the back bedroom, soon to be my office, and got the carpet up and rolled in no time!

 I started pulling up the carpet pad, and by the vent I found a little paper package. Despite the warnings of a curse, I am still *"in need of $"* afterall, I opened it and found some snipped up baseball cards. I was confused at first trying to piece them together as the image side didn't make any sense, but on the back of the cards was a treasure map! __SUPER COOL!__

OK, so while I'd like to go out and check this all out, it's a frozen winter wonderland outside. That isn't going to happen for a few months yet. BUT...

Soon it will be treasure hunting time... Soon...

In the mean time, it appears that there may also be indoor treasure too...

The tiny bit of text there on the left says "in the railing of the stairs" and seems to be pointing to the split, entry way stairs. Will we find hidden treasure under the carpet? In the railing? The mystery! The excitement! 

That wasn't the only fun hidden for me... Peeling back a bit more of the carpet pad I found this:

Moving on to the next bedroom, or Martin's soon to be office.

I wasn't surprised when I turned up more treasure. Had it just been me, I probably wouldn't have thought twice about just tossing the sports cards, but Martin recognized them both as Hall of Famers. So we're holding onto these.

I was able to pull the carpet out of the room, but getting it down the stairs and out to the garage was a bit much to try alone. Once all the noise was done, Kyo decided that he was brave enough to inspect things.  The lovely rose colored carpet was from the first bedroom, which I forgot to photo before tearing it out. (Sorry Mom!)
