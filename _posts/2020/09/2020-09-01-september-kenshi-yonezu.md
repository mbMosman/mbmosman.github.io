Wow... I can't believe it is September, though I see the leaves starting to change and have needed blankets to keep the windows open. Somewhere along the way I stopped counting how long it's been me and my cats, just chilling here at the house. Good thing too, as it looks like it'll be that same story the rest of the year. 

Following up on the weekend of music... (I'd like to think I got my $30 worth via multiple repeat watches of Miyavi's live show.) I've been scanning YouTube again for new bits to add to my "Get me through the day" playlist. (In need of some curating now, as it's more than 32 hours...) 

Anyhow, as I was poking through some "top 100" lists of JPop/KPop, I found this gem from Kenshi Yonezu (米津玄師).

It's from his 5th (newest) album, Stray Sheep ([YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb02MaZXm5_OzmFHdshL4qnPP-sDQ6H_e)), which is on the whole absolutely amazing. I *__love__* every single track on it. 

This isn't the first time he's popped up on my radar, I'm just realizing that I should probably consider myself a fan.  

Here's one of the older pieces that I really like too.

And because it's so hard not to do one more...

And I also learned that [WagakkiBand] is also releasing a new album in mid-October with the release of their new music video and single *"Singing For..."*

Seems to be a song of hope and reunion? 

Happy almost autumn!
