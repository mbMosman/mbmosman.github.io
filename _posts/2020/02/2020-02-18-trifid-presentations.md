My Trifid Cohort from [Prime](https://primeacademy.io/) did an amazing job with their client project presenations today. As mentioned earlier, they are both smart...

Their presentations were streamed out on [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/primedigitalacademy/videos/186412575946593/) if you missed them. Check it out! My students were amazing! I, on the other hand, kinda did my parts a wee bit backwards. Opps... This is why I will not be rewatching the video. ^.^

Super excited for them as they're approaching graduation on Friday. They've been a really awesome group. I feel like I always say this about my students, but that doesn't make it any less true. This group has seen a lot of change through their time at Prime, but they've really come together as a group over the last 4-5 weeks. I truly couldn't be more proud of them. They've all worked so well here as teams for these projects and really brought out the best in each other. 

Started out the day with a nasty commute from yesterday's rain/snow mix, but once again the view out the windows in the morning was glorious. Best part is the sun was coming up!!!
