So it's June... Not sure how that happened, but this starts the 12th week that I've been more or less entirely at home. Things of late have been pretty crazy with the protests, riots & curfews that have filled the cities since the [death of George Floyd at the hands of Mpls Police](https://www.mprnews.org/crime-law-and-justice/killing-of-george-floyd).

The last week has been pretty crazy here. It's something I don't think you can really feel or understand if you're not a part of it. I can't believe the things I've heard from friends and on the news are really happening __*here*__... in the place I call __*home*__.  It's just unbelievable. 

I was pretty stressed out before all this started. This last weekend has really tested my stress management capabilities to their limits. For me, this has been a crazy mess of negative emotions - a lot of anger & frustration but also disappointment. The hardest part of this for me is knowing that this is how I feel being somewhat on the outside of it all. It must be ever so much harder to be on the *inside*.

Anyhow... abruptly changing the topic... 

While all that is going on life still continues. My Dijkstra cohort at Prime is working their way through their group projects, and getting ready to graduate next week. My next crew, Paxos is right behind them, getting ready to start full-time in less than two weeks. I won't get my week of vacation in between thanks to Covid pushing our schedule out, but I am looking forward to a little vacation the week of July 4th. Down side is  that will mostly be spent getting my kitchen back together, so is it really a vacation?

I did get most of my items moved off the dining room table and back bedroom and into the kitchen. That's been helpful, but my cooking options are still pretty limited with no range or microwave. I've been mainly eating cold food, but yesterday I broke out the little hot-plate to cook some eggs for breakfast. Had some scrambled eggs and burnt toast, but it was kinda heavenly.

So over lunch yesterday I picked up more flooring for the kitchen. The goal is to get it in this weekend. I have spend the last few days doing some appliance research and shopping to try and capitalize on the Labor Day Sales. I did get appliances ordered, and since some people can't wait to see, so I'll link what I got here...

This has been a months long project, started pre-Covid and well before the recent turblent events here in the cities and now across the US. Had I known in February where the world was heading I may have reconsidered the timing of this time intensive and pricey project. I'll be glad when it is over and I can take a little time to really just relax and not be thinking of the long list of things awaiting both my free time and money.
