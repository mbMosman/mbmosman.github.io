My 8th Prime cohort Paxos started full-time today! Woot!!! 

They're a pretty big group, starting out with 20. This will be my first cohort to start remote. It'll be interesting to see how this will affect them, if at all. Of course I suppose it will be hard to tell... They seem to have done just fine getting to know each other a bit remotely over the always remote, initial part of the program. 

I decided that to kick off the new cohort, I would sport a new hair color. This time we are going for blue, starting with a bit of a silvery-grey blue. The pink hasn't entirely come out though, so it's still got a good bit of pink mixed in, particularly in the back.
