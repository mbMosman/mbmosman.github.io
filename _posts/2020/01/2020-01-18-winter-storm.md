The big news everyone in MN has talking about the last few days is the weather. We called it an early day Friday with the snow fall starting in the afternoon and continuing through the night into Saturday morning. I came home to 4-5" of snow on the driveway. 

Fortunately I also came home to find Martin who came by to show me how to run the snowblower. He had also nicely plowed most of the driveway, so that I could park in the garage. He left me just a quick run down and back to get the hang of it. So sweet! 

I must say the snow blower is pretty awesome. It's an intimidating bit of machinery, but oh so powerful. We only got an inch or so more snow overnight into Saturday morning, and that was shoveled off pretty quickly. However the snow plow also came through overnight leaving a mess of plowed up snow at the end of the driveway. That is wet, icy, and heavy. I hate shoveling it. To do that takes more time than doing the whole driveway & walk. However it is no match for the snowblower. I whipped it out (only stalling once) and had it all done in just a few minutes.

I'd say overall there might have been about 6", but most of that came down Friday afternoon and evening. As is so typical in MN, the worry before the storm was mostly for naught.
