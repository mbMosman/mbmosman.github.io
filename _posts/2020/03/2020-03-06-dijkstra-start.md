My new [Prime](https://primeacademy.io/) Cohort, Dijkstra, started their onsite classes this past Monday. Woot! 

We're off to a good start! They've been super helpful to each other this week in class. Usually it takes a bit for people to open up, but these folks are jumping right in. They also impressed the socks off me with their Friday speaches about someone they admire or appreciate. Almost brought a tear to my eye. 

I was intending to get a picture of them, but in true Mary fashion, I forgot.
