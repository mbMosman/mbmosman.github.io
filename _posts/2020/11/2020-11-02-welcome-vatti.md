Happy to welcome my 9th Prime cohort into Tier 2, the full-time part of the program. Woot! It's going to be a great winter with you all!

This is my 2nd fully remote cohort, and they'll almost certainly be my 3rd group to graduate remote in February. I must say, I'm really impressed by how well this group is already working together. They are going to be remote collaboration masters, totally ready for this new remote work world. I don't think I've seen this much work together both via Zoom and Slack before the full-time Tier 2 start in my entire Prime history. 

We've got quite a week ahead of us with a day off class right away on Tuesday for the election. Prime has awesomely decided this year that the day is a non-work day for staff and students to get out the vote. It's about time that *all* work places do that to facilitate opportunities for everyone to vote without having to make choices between voting, work and/or school. It really should just be a national holiday.

Anyhow, I'm really optimistic about where this awesome cohort will go.  They're off to a great start. Totally *primed* for success!
