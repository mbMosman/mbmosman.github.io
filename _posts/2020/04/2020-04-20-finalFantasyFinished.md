So glad to have had a day off today! After 65 in-game hours, I've finished up the Final Fantasy VII Remake. I can't wait for the next part to come out!!!  

There's still more to do if I care to push for completion and work those achievements, but I think I'll pass on that for now. I worked my way through all (I think) of the side-quests. Although, I could replay with different choices or harder difficulty, I think I'll pass on that. It was hard enough while still being fun. I'm going to rest on that feeling of supreme enjoyment. 

In other news this week, Fred discovered he can use the hangers as a step to the top of the closet. I'm not sure I am pleased... However, it has become his new *spot*. Looking for Fred, check here.

Kyo couldn't be bothered to make such an effort. He's content with the heated blanket on the storage shelf.

On the other side of things, we're starting week 6 at home. I really needed the day off, and not just to play Final Fantasy. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster of work and home stuff, and OMG does the constant video meetings take a toll. I never really thought it would make that much of a difference, but I can barely stand to be on the computer once the day is over. No wonder I'm now watching so much TV! Granted, this last week it was more gaming on the PS4/TV with FF... 

I wish I could take more time off, but holding out for my cohort to graduate. They're so awesome. Starting projects soon!!! Woot! Almost there!
