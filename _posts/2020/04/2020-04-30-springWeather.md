Well, I finally feel like Spring is really here! The weather the last few days has been great, and finally today I got out to really enjoy it. Finished up work and went out to kick back in the hammock.

The colors are beautiful. I love the contrast in the fresh greens and the blue sky.

With the warming weather, the bird feeder has been a hit with some new guests.

House Finch (*I think?*)

Some guests were more startling than others... I heard quacking this moring, and sure enough when I looked out the window there were ducks! There's no water close to the house, at least not any that I've seen... but there are ducks.

Mom said I need to get a kiddie pool for them.

Martin is planning on coming by this weekend so he could pack up his remaining stuff, including the basement tools, and then rent a truck to cart it all off. On the one hand, this is great, as there's a pile of stuff in the middle of the basement where I'd like to finish painting. On the other hand, I'll probably be missing those tools as I get around to finishing the floor and kitchen remodel.
