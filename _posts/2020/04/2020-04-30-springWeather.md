Well, I finally feel like Spring is really here! The weather the last few days has been great, and finally today I got out to really enjoy it. Finished up work and went out to kick back in the hammock.

The colors are beautiful. I love the contrast in the fresh greens and the blue sky.

With the warming weather, the bird feeder has been a hit with some new guests.

House Finch (*I think?*)

Some guests were more startling than others... I heard quacking this moring, and sure enough when I looked out the window there were ducks! There's no water close to the house, at least not any that I've seen... but there are ducks.

Mallard Ducks!

Mom said I need to get a kiddie pool for them.

Oh! And you might not have noticed, as I don't often photo myself, but I refreshed the hair a bit. It was long overdue. I had actually planned to get it professionally done, but well, covid.  So instead I once again cleaned up the roots myself and added a fresh splash of pink. Woot!

Fortunately I still had some bleach. That's the last of my pink though. I guess, I'll have to start looking online. Perhaps I'll consider another color for the next time...

Martin is planning on coming by this weekend so he could pack up his remaining stuff, including the basement tools, and then rent a truck to cart it all off. On the one hand, this is great, as there's a pile of stuff in the middle of the basement where I'd like to finish painting. On the other hand, I'll probably be missing those tools as I get around to finishing the floor and kitchen remodel.
