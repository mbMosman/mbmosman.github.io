After temperatures dropped for the last week, it's finally windows open again. Got to enjoy some dinner on the deck. Woot! Do I want to know how many weeks we've been at home now? ( It's 9 weeks now I think... )

There were a lot of great things about this week. First, the kitchen cabinets came. The whole delivery thing was a bit more of a mess than I would have liked, but they are here now. Finally. Hanging out in my garage waiting patiently for someone to come unbox and check them out. 

Next, up, my current Dijkstra cohort at Prime presented their solo projects and they absolutely rocked them. Amazing work all around. They're really rolling with this remote work world we've found ourselves in. So very proud of all their efforts and the awesome payoff. Also, special thanks to Kris who ran the presentations while I was waiting for the cabinets to show. Also on the work front, we had a guest lecturer from our Kansas City campus, something that probably wouldn't have happened before Covid sent us remote. 

Last but not least, my mortgage refinance finally closed, freeing Martin from the loan and getting me a sweet low rate. I've now got a 20 year vs the 30 year we had earlier with only about $70 more on the payment per month. I'm quite pleased by that. House paid before retirement! Yes!!! On top of the sweet deal, the process was also super quick. They're nowing having us review the documents in advance, and then going in for final signatures. It took maybe 15 minutes in the office. Woot! That process improvement really needs to remain in place.
