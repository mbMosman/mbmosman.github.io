title:  Spring Again
preview: After temperatures dropped for the last week, it's finally windows open again. Got to enjoy some dinner on the deck. Woot! Do I want to know how many weeks we've been at home now? ( It's 9 I think... )

After temperatures dropped for the last week, it's finally windows open again. Got to enjoy some dinner on the deck. Woot! Do I want to know how many weeks we've been at home now? ( It's 9 I think... )

There were a lot of great things about this week. First, the kitchen cabinets came. The whole delivery thing was a bit more of a mess than I would have liked, but they are here now. Finally. Hanging out in my garage waiting patiently for someone to come unbox and check them out.
