The cabinets are __*really*__ in now. I'm happy that work at least is all done! I can move my dishes and pantry things back into the kitchen, and now I have more space to store things! Woot! 

In the old *eat-in* part of the kitchen I've now got a pantry area!

There are some pull out shelves/drawers on the end...

A lazy susan in the corner...

And a fancy *pantry* cabinet on the other side. Woot!!!

The sink & dishwasher area... There's a board over the *sink* spot so the cats don't fall in.

The range & fridge spot. In the left corner, there's another lazy susan and a pull-out spice rack.

I'm so happy with how it all turned out!!! Excited to be able to start moving things back into the kitchen and off the dining room table and back bedroom floor! Woot!!!

Next step is the counter tops, which I'll be waiting a bit for. They come to measure next Tuesday. Hopefully it won't take too long after that to get them in and installed.*Fingers crossed.*


It started raining last night after dinner, and I spent some time lounging on the couch just listening to the rain fall. It was super relaxing. I eventually got myself cleanedup and ready for bed around 9, then popped open the bedroom window to fall asleep to rainfall. I slept so well... It was good to have a nice long, peaceful sleep. It's been a busy weekend, so glad to have things pause for a few days at least on the reno.
