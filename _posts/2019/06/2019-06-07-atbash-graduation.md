My 4th cohort graduated from Prime today! Woot! They've been so amazing, and I'm going to miss seeing them so much. But I'm so excited to see where life takes them from here!

We had a lot of fun over the last 14 weeks, but today was super exciting! I got to slay a unicorn!!! In pi√±ata form, but still... The unicorn is a formidable foe!

It was a good thing I practiced some kendo. I got in a many good swings, more than I could count, though I didn't find it quite as effective with the plastic broom handle sword... It had a bit of give in the middle where the handle extends... Excuses, I know... 

The weak point was the point where the head met the body! A few good strikes there and we had a hole, but finally I gave up and just ripped it's head off.

To get a rain of awesome custom Atbash confetti (with little rainbow 'Woot!'s and Atbash T-Rexes) and candy. Woot! They even got me Japanese sweets! Those Atbashers are so awesome & thoughtful!

I'm going to miss having them in class so much!!!  Best wishes to you all Atbash! I know you'll do amazing things!
