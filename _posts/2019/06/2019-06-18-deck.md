It's been a while since I updated on the house... I'm still dealing with problems with my right arm and elbow, so I've not done much myself. However Martin is still busy with lots of things. The biggest project has been staining the deck. He finished sanding last week and has gotten a good bit of staining finished.

In addition to this, he's also been working on making us a new bed frame with storage drawers underneath. He's got a bottom frame to lift it off the ground done, and the drawer container part mostly done (needs some edge finish and paint), but still waiting on the drawers themselves and a fancy-pants bookshelf headboard. I'm super excited about this, as I am hoping the cats will want to sleep on the bookshelf headboard instead of my feet & legs pinning me into bed. That's all fine in the winter when it's cold, but now it just makes me too hot!

There's a ton of other little projects we need to wrap up. We probably need a project list... Guess neither of us are a good PM (project manager).
