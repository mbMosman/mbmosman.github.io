title: Madison Trip 
preview: Spent the weekend in Madison with Christy. It was a great visit. Good chance to rest and recuperate. Just what I needed!

Christy usually comes back to the Twin Cities on the weekends and comes to visit me, but this time I felt like I had a little more time on my hands with my cohort graduated, and decided to make the trip to visit her in Madison. It's about a 4 hour drive, but not too bad at all. I left late Saturday morning and arrived just before 2PM. We had a great time hanging out that evening and just catching up on things. It's been a while since we got together without an agenda or time window looming. We headed out for dinner at [Monty's Blue Plate Diner](https://montysblueplatediner.com/), then spent more time just hanging out and playing with her cats - Whim & Willow.

Sunday we had breakfast at [Lazy Jane's Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/Lazy-Janes-Cafe-58012837020/), where I had an awesome lemon scone and Christy had an amazingly fluffy looking waffle. Then we spent the afternoon at the [Olbrich Botanical Gardens](http://www.olbrich.org/). The gardens were amazingly beautiful and relaxing. If I lived near there, I think I'd be there all the time!

There were so many different kinds of trees, and shrubs and flowers! 

This one I think was an ornamental garlic or onion...

The were *common* flowers like snapdragons and violets, but they hardly felt common...

And there were more unusual plants too! Like this one called a ballgown, which I think looks more like a lantern.

We saw some wildlife too. We saw bunnies, chipmunks, so many birds, turtles, and even some frogs well hidden in a pond. We only started to look close enough to find the frogs after we heard some kids competing to see who could find more.
