Outside of the house projects, it's been a busy week. Martin's dad was in the hospital and is finishing up his recovery in a nearby nursing home now. He's doing fine, but he and Miki will need to think about what comes next. The house they live in now has all the bedrooms and only bath on the 2nd floor and it's looking like that won't be doable for him now. They are talking about options, such as remodeling or moving, so continuing to live "at home" is a more realistic option.
