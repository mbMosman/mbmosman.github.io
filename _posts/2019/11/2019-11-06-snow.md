Well, today it seems winter is officially here with our first messy, snowy commute. The snow was really pretty drifting past my window this morning.

However what it did to the traffic this morning was anything but. My usual 10 minute drive to the bus station in Burnsville turned into an hour long stop and go through the city streets, just to get to the station. Fortunately the bus did a bit better heading up the highway, but instead of getting there at 8, I was lucky to scoot in just in time to start class at 9.

It'll be interesting to see what winter brings us this year...
