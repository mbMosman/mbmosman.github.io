title: Humming Birds!
preview:  Our bird feeder has been a hit. We've gone through an entire bag of feed, and when shopping for more Martin decided to get a feeder for the humming birds that have been zipping around the house as well.

Our bird feeder has been a hit. We've gone through an entire bag of feed, and when shopping for more Martin decided to get a feeder for the humming birds that have been zipping around the house as well.


It's also been a hit so far. Martin saw three out there the other day, but they're hard to photo. Here's an attempt at one...

It's hard to tell what kind they might be... They look grey to me, so maybe they are ladies or young ones.  

I also forgot to mention that I've adopted an old rope hammock and stand from Christy following their summer garage clean out. I've been thoroughly enjoying it. I've got it set up out back, in the shade near the deck. It's a nice place to hang out with a book and watch the birds at the feeder. I've also been visited by squirrels, chipmunks, bunnies, and the neighbor's dog (sigh) while dozing there too.
