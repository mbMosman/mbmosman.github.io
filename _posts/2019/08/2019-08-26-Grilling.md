Our second brisket grilling adventure was a success! We invited Dave over for dinner this time and kicked back on the deck for a lovely little evening. Had some tastey beef brisket, rosemary potatoes, green beens, rolls, and some really yummy grapes (not usually my thing).

We also picked up some patio chairs from Home Depot - on sale no less - so that we could eat out of the cat zone on the new table Martin made. It was really nice! Weather was perfect and the birds stopping in at the feeder made for some nice evening bird watching too.

It was such a great success we decided to go for round three next weekend and invite the Spencers. Woot!
