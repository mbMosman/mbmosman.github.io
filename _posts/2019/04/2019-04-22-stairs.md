I came home to quite a surprise today. Martin got the stairs put in! Woot!

We have fancy stairs now. I'm super impressed by how good they look! 

Glad to see all my earlier staining efforts paid off. They looked good on their own, but they really shine next to the white trim. I never imagined they would turn out this well. So awesome!!!
