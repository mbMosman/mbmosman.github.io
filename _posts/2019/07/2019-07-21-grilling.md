Work on the deck is mostly done, stairs have been stained. It's just the underneath and sides left now. Martin's been busy designing and making a new table for our Big Green Egg. It's finally finished & we've moved our new grill out.

We had our first little grill-fest with lots of hamburgers, hotdogs, & brauts to keep us going all week.

The deck should be a great place to kick back and relax once we've got somewhere to sit. It's been fairly nice so far this summer. There are so many trees and a lot of shade. We've been able to keep the windows open and enjoy the fresh air. Not that there haven't been days that are super hot, where the a/c is appreciated, but this is a nice change from the old place where it was all sun and little to no shade and the a/c ran overtime for half the year. 

Martin's dad should be back at home next weekend, so we're hoping to have everyone over for a 2nd round of grill-fest!
