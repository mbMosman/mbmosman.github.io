While we've been waiting on the new floors to acclimate, we've started pulling down trim and priming the walls. We got the Master Bedroom finished up yesterday, and Martin finished pulling out the trim from the offices and primed the hallway today.

I'm so excited to be able to get the floors in and move-in. It'll be nice to have things settled. Soon... One more week I hope.

It's been snowy, which hasn't been fun for driving, but it does make the backyard look pretty.

I was back at work today, and it was so awesome to see that the Sirius cohort stickers were in! Woot! It's the green, octo-dino with the taco, in case you're not in the know...

I also got to chat with some alumni, with a promise to see more of them tomorrow. Awesome!!! I really do miss them when they graduate. It makes my day to hear from one or see them when they stop in to visit.
