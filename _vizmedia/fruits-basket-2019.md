Yay! Fruits Basket lives again! I'm excited for this new version of the anime as it is meant to follow the full story from the manga (which the earlier anime production did not). Woot! I can't wait to meet __*all*__ the characters this time!

Christy and I kicked off our Spring 2019 anime watching with the first two episodes and while I wasn't as keen on the new skinny art look, the story was familiar and as endearing as ever. While the story is the same so far, there are some little sneak peeks at what is to come - for example a little baseball cap is popping up here and there, which has significance we'll learn about later on. It's cool that this seems to stick a little closer to the manga story and go a little deeper perhaps into the storylines of Tohru & our Sohma Zodiac.
