This was a kinda random pick from Netflix, but I did enjoy it. I would have appreciated a little less of the gratuitous sex and violence, but that seems to come with the times. It's similar to other historical dramas like the Tudors or Vikings, but set in Mongolia in the court of Kublai Khan. 

Can't speak to historical or cultural accuracy, but it made for good TV. I wished there was just a little more of to wrap the story better. It felt like they needed to wrap things up, but also wanted to leave it open for more. Looks like it was canceled after that second season, resulting in a $200 million loss for Netflix. Bummer I guess...
