> Somehow, the guitar that he used to love to play and the basketball games that he found so fun just lost their appeal... That was until Ritsuka Uenoyama randomly met Mafuyu Sato. Ritsuka had started losing his passion for music in his everyday life, but then he hears Mafuyu sing for the first time. The song resonates with his heart and the distance between them starts to change.

This was an accidental find while I was perusing what other people enjoyed this last anime season. I watched the first episode, going in blind and thought it was pretty good, BUT I am so tired of the BL (boy love) right now. I didn't *know* that was where it was going, but it all but obvious that was where it was going. So I looked up a summary and of course that was where it was going, *but* it was getting great reviews. So I decided to hop on the band wagon and at least watch another episode or two. That resulted of a binge watch to catch me up to what was current and had me waiting not very patiently for the remainder of the season to be released. 

It's a well told story with great characters and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It also echoes a bit a recent manga read [Solanin](manga/solanin.html). If the BL puts you off not because you mind the same-sex romance but because you are sick of shallow plots and poor excuses for a setup, then hop right on in. While there's clear setup here, there's also interesting characters and good story. I understand there's another story arc in the manga, and if that is also made into a 2nd season, I'll be watching from the start.
