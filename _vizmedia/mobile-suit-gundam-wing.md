So growing up, my fondest elementary school memories are from watching Voltron on TV. I loved that show... I knew the opening credits by heart, and I even recall making myself a little bedside endtable out of a cardboard box with those opening lines written on there. Little wonder then that later, *all grown-up*, I would fall for Gundam Wing. While I don't adore all of the mecha anime, or for that mater the incredibly sad re-make of Voltron, the story and characters of Gundam Wing have stuck with me over the years. 

The anime is memorable for it's rather timeless plot woven with political intrigue and fate-woven group of characters. Unlike other mecha anime, it's more story driven than techy, mecha battle driven - though that of course plays it's part too. My favorite character is Duo; he's just clearly the coolest of the bunch.
