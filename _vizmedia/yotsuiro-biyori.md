Four guys are working together in a cute little traditional cafe called Rokuhōdō. In typical Mary fashion I got sucked in by the cute orange cat. Surely no anime with a cat can be bad, right?

Anyhow Sui inherited from his grandfather. He apparently quite his office job to do this, seemingly disappointing family. There's some unresolved issues with his brother that is a bit of an underlying theme through some of the episodes. Overall though the anime is more about the food and making the customers feel at home and sometimes helping them out with little problems. It clearly features the food, but unlike some other foodie anime, this one is as much about the people too.

It's quite cute. Sui is the cat lover. Tokitaka was his friend from school and is their chef. He also does pottery. Gure is the crazy fit one who makes notoriously bad latte art. Dessert is handled by Tsubaki, who of course loves sweets. Last but not least is the cat who lured me in, Kinako, who features in my favorite episode, the 2nd half of episode 4, An Incident, Meow - where a mystery kitten spends some time with them.
