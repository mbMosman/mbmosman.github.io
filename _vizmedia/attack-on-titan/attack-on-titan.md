I was just about to dive into the new season when Martin and I picked up anime night again and I decided to try this out on him. Seems like it is going well so far. Woot! 

I must say that when I first started watching this, I did not expect to like it. It was all hyped, and I figured I'd watch to see what it was all about. The titans start eating people, and ish!!! I was close to tossing it after the first episode, but then remembered my friend Grant's 3 episode rule. By the 3rd episode I was hooked and had to see where this was going. Fortunately the titans aren't *always* there eating people. There's room here for some depth, so I'm curious to see whether or not the show delivers on any of that.
