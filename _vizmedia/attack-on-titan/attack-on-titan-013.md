  Jean manages to acquire another set of omni-directional mobility gear from a dead soldier and escapes, thanks to Annie, Connie and Marco Bott distracting the Titans. With Eren as a Titan carrying the boulder towards the gate, Ian orders everyone to protect Eren from the Titans at all costs. Eren finally blocks the open gate with the boulder, and Rico fires a yellow flare to signal that the operation was a success. As Armin tries to pull Eren from his Titan body, they are cornered by two Titans, but Levi saves them in the nick of time. All Titans remaining in the Trost Districts are eliminated except two, which are captured for research. Jean, Sasha and Annie all mourn the deaths of their fellow comrades among several casualties. Meanwhile, Eren is chained in a cell guarded by the Military Police Regiment, where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin Smith of the Scout Regiment. After listening to his story and reasons for wanting the Titans dead, Levi allows Eren to join his squad under his command, though Eren is warned that Levi would personally kill him if he ever betrays the squad or loses control again.
