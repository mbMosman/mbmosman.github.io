  The supply depot is surrounded by Titans, but Armin plots to use the mysterious dark-haired Titan to defeat them. They fight off the Titan's attacking him, and lure him to the depot. Armin's plan works, so while the mystery Titan attract the enemies outside, the group sneaks in to the depot to resupply. Inside, they must fight a group of smaller Titans to get to fuel storage. Armin devises another plan to draw the Titans' attention to an elevator, then shoot them in the eyes to blind them, while their best seven attack from the ceiling behind to finish them off. Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets, but are saved by Mikasa and Annie. Successful, they refuel and prepare to retreat. Leaving, they see the mystery Titan collapse, and are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body. Mikasa reaches Eren and cries upon confirming that he is alive. Armin is surprised to see that Eren's severed leg and arm have been regenerated...

Woot! Armin gets his moment in the spotlight and proves his worth to the team! Awesome! And well, of course we all knew Eren couldn't *really* be dead. (This isn't Game of Thrones...)
