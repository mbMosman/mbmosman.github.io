  Eren climbs out of the partially transformed Titan, telling Mikasa and Armin about the basement in his former house. He believes that it holds the secret to mankind's preservation and the key to destroying the Titans. Kitts once again orders the cannon to be loaded out of fear. Eren comes up with two plans of escape. The first is for Eren to retreat as a Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity, and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger. Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite his cowardice, deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed. Armin tentatively convinces Kitts, only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in. Eren agrees, regardless of whether or not he will be able to control himself as a Titan.

Not only does Armin save the day, but he realized his friends always realized he could and depended on his cleverness too!
