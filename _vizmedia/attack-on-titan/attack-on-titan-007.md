  The surviving squads are low on gas for their mobility gear and unable to reach the inner walls. Seeing the supply depot is overrun by Titans, they lose their will to fight. Mikasa joins them and learns that Armin's entire squad has perished, including Eren. Seemingly undaunted, she rallies the others to reclaim the supply depot, but Mikasa ends up running out of gas midair and falls into an alleyway. Jean assumes command, but he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans. As a Titan approaches, Mikasa prepares to attack with her remaining broken blade knowing she won't survive. However, a mysterious dark haired Titan appears behind her, and saves her by brutally killing the Titan. Armin and Conny show up, shocked to witness the mysterious Titan not only fighting other Titans, but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand-to-hand combat techniques, while completely ignoring the humans. Armin gives Mikasa his gas tanks and blades so that she can support the others at the supply depot. Mikasa, however, refuses to leave him behind to die.

This is cool both because it shows that Mikasa isn't as cold hearted as she appears, and because it shows Armin is clever enough to realize this and jump in to help his friend. They really do a great job of showing the friendship between this trio of Armin, Mikasa, and Eren.
