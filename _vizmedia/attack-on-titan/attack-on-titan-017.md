  As the 57th Expedition gets underway, the Scout Regiment assemble into their Long-Range Scouting Formation, wherein the Scouts spread out around the main wagon train and report by flare gun if Titans are nearby so the group can alter course to avoid conflict with them if possible. After Armin's squad manages to kill an Abnormal Titan, a Female Titan suddenly appears from the right flank at high speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body withstands their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin, but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean, who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans. Armin then realizes that the Female Titan is possibly another intelligent Titan like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting locations for where Eren is in the formation, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and that they must stop her. Avoiding their failed attempts to attack, she leaves them and heads towards the center group.
