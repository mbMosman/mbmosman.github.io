  Armin, Reiner and Jean are left stranded after their encounter with the Female Titan. They are left with only one horse, but they are soon saved by Christa who arrives with extra horses. They wait for the order to withdraw, but to their surprise, they discover that the operation is continuing albeit heading in a different direction. Meanwhile, news reaches the center group about the annihilation of their right flank by the Female Titan as she continues to wreak havoc within the formation. The whole formation soon reaches the Forest of Giant Trees with only the center row entering, while the rest defend the forest from Titans. Eren realizes something is wrong when his squad has no idea what Erwin's orders are and what Levi is doing. As the Female Titan chases at their heels, the squad desperately await Levi's command to attack, but Levi instead tells his squad to cover their ears as he fires his flare gun.
