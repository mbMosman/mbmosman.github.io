  Armin awakens to find Eren missing and blames himself not being strong enough to save him. Meanwhile, the exit gate is blocked by a merchant cart while a crowd of refugees is trying to escape. An abberant Titan appears and starts charging the gate, but the crowd is saved by Mikasa, who kills the Titan, and then threatens the greedy merchant until he allows the refugees to pass first. We then flashback to earlier in Mikasa's childhood when, Mikasa was kidnapped by three slave traders, who murdered her parents in a struggle. Eren & his father discovered the bodies, and disobeying his father, Eren went off on his own and tracked down the kidnappers. He and Mikasa killing them and escape. Eren's courage allowed Mikasa to overcame her fear own fear and and gain the resolve to fight back. With her parents dead, Mikasa goes to live with Eren and his parents. Back in the present, the battle continues, with Mikasa slaying more Titans before going back to help the other squads evacuate.

I feel for Armin, who's just not as *tough* as his friends and seems to always be getting rescued. It's hard to feel like you're always depending on someone else. I really like Mikasa's character for being quite the badass, but at the same time I kinda feel bad for her too. She seems to have a shell around her, and others clearly see her as a cold person. She clearly cares deeply for her friends though, so she's not as heartless as she comes off.
