  The Colossal Titan destroys the wall's cannons, but it vanishes into a burst of steam before Eren prepares to attack its weak point. The Military Police Regiment scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses before the Titans enter the city. Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison Regiment to different squads, Mikasa helps with the evacuation, while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. As Eren and Armin's squad attack, their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one, with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fates, is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed. Eren, recalling when he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls, manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan's mouth at the last moment. He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan's mouth, but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's arm and swallowing him.

Oh nos! Eren get's swallowed up! But how sweet saving his friend... Is it bad that not for a moment do I really believe Eren will be dead? (Even the first time, I didn't buy it!)
