  Mikasa tries to reason with Eren in as he is a Titan, but to no avail. Eren continues his attack and accidentally incapacitates himself, slumping to the ground. The squad protecting Eren sends up a red flare to signal that the plan has failed, much to the dismay of the troops observing from the wall. As Armin heads toward Eren to investigate, the elite squadron argues and eventually agrees to protect Eren instead of abandoning him, still recognizing him as a valuable military asset. During the operation, Jean is separated from Connie and Annie after his omni-directional mobility gear malfunctions, forcing him to hide from two Titans in a building. Armin reaches the unconscious Eren, but Mikasa calls to him, warning that he is in a dangerous state. Armin plunges his sword into the side of Eren's neck, which briefly awakens him. As Armin speaks to him of the outside world and reminds him of his promise to kill all the Titans, Eren leaves his dreamlike state and regains control.

Oh nos! Eren get's swallowed up! But how sweet saving his friend... Is it bad, though, that not even for a moment do I really believe Eren is dead? (OK, yes, so I've seen this before... But even the first time, I didn't buy it!)
