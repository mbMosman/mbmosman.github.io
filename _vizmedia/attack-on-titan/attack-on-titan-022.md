  While Mikasa distracts the Female Titan in order to get Eren back, Levi debilitates her, but injures his leg while saving Mikasa. They retrieve Eren from the mouth of the Titan, leaving it badly wounded but alive as they make their escape. Meanwhile, the Scout Regiment retrieves most of the corpses of their comrades, but some were irretrievable due to the swarming Titans. Erwin orders them to go, leaving those remaining to be reported missing in action. Two disobey to retrieve a friend, but they return chased by two Titans. One is killed by Mikasa, but the other is gaining on the group. To outrun the other Titan, Levi orders them to dispose the corpses to lighten the wagon's load. Later, Eren wakes up from a dream to find they have returned. The townspeople not only berate the Scout Regiment's ineptitude, but also become enraged and upset at Erwin over the failure of the mission and the casualties that were sustained. As a result of the failed expedition, Erwin and his subordinates are summoned to the capital, where the final decision of Eren's custody will be made.
