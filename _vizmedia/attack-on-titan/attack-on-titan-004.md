  Five years since Wall Maria fell, Keith evaluates the recruits for their strengths and weaknesses. After training in hand-to-hand combat with Reiner and Annie Leonhart, Eren learns later that night that Jean and several other recruits hope to join the Military Police Regiment to avoid having to fight Titans. On graduation day, Eren and Mikasa rank among the top ten of their class. They are eligible to join the Military Police Regiment, but Eren declines and announces that he is joining the Scout Regiment on the front lines, leading Armin and Mikasa to join him. They are assigned to the Trost District, one of the cities which is at the outer edge of Wall Rose, where they discover other classmates have joined. The Colossal Titan appears and breaches the gate. Once Eren regains his composure, he takes command and orders a counterattack.
