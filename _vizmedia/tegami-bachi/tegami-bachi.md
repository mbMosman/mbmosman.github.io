I had started reading the manga for this a year or so ago, as it was available electronically from the library. Somewhere along the way I got distracted and quit, but then bumped into this randomly browsing through the Crunchyroll A-Z listings. I remembered the story being pretty cool, so decided to check it out & haven't been disappointed.
