The first season of the anime was great. It lured me into reading the manga as I can't seem to get enough of these characters. 

I'm so glad that there is now a 2nd season of the anime. I can't wait to see the story I've enjoyed from the managa animated and brought to life.

Finally got another anime night in with Christy to kick-off season 2. We watched the first 3 episodes. It seemed a bit of a slow start to me, maybe because the pattern of the episodes is a little different. We aren't meeting a new Yokai each episode that needs help here. There are some new Underworld characters introduced, but where things are going isn't really clear yet.
