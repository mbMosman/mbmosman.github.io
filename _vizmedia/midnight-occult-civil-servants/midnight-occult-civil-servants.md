> When Miyako Arata joins the Shinjuku Ward Office, he thinks he's gotten a normal civil servant job. But it turns out he's joined the Night Community Exchange Department, one of which operates secretly in each of Tokyo's twenty-three ward offices. Their job is to resolve occult issues concerning non-human beings. Accompanied by his senpai and department head Sakaki Kyoichi and the occult obsessed Himeduka Theo, they work night after night, facing off with beings whose existence defies the laws of our world.

After finishing up the 2nd season of the Morose Mononokean, Christy and I found ourselves in need of something else to watch. This was her pick, mostly based on (I think) the rather strange name. It's pretty cute. We kinda binged through the first 6 episodes and will probably continue on.

So... it's been a while now, and Christy and I haven't had many anime opportunities. That's a genuine bummer, but I don't think I'm sorry to have left this show behind. It was OK, but there are better things out there to watch. This is falling to the "not likely to finish" bucket.
