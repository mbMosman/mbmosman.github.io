This is about two orphan boys who grew up together at a church, Yuno & Asta. Asta has appears to have no magic in a world where magic is common, something everyone has a bit of. Despite this he is insistent that he'll become the Wizard King. He becomes Yuno's inspiration, after rescuing him from a fight. Asta is both stubborn, persistent, and strong. Yuno seems to have the better chance of becoming the Wizard King. However, Yuno never stops believing that Asta will somehow do what seems impossible and considers him his somewhat friendly rival.

From the ending lyrics:
> 明日を選ぶのは　君自身しかいないよ　越えていこう　今日までの僕らを   
> But you’re the only one who can choose your own tomorrow. So let’s overcome who we’ve been until today!

I'm all about these sort of underdog overcoming obstacles stories, and childhood friends/rivals are like icing on the cake. The first few episodes progress pretty quickly through the plot, though it is really just one event per episode.
I expect we'll eventually get a good bit of magical battles too, which I hope will manage not to completely turn each episode into nothing but one battle after another, though I'm expecting to be a bit like Bleach...
