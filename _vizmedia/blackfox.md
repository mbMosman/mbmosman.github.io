> Living in a ninja residence tucked away in a corner of a futuristic city is Rikka, the eldest daughter of a Ninja clan, who looks up to her father—a researcher—very much. Carrying on with her life normally, Rikka's home came suddenly under attack one day. Driven into a corner, what would she do to overcome this crisis? Rip darkness to pieces and become "BLACKFOX"!

Great movie! Won't supplant my Miyazaki favorites, but it's a fun and heart-warming action/adventure. I was initially a little disappointed, as the previews had me all excited for this and I thought it was a series not a movie. On the birght-side however, you get the full story all in one ~90 min swoop. There's finality with open-endedness, so maybe there will be more adventures in the future, but I'm quite happy with what I got.
