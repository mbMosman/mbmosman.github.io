> Mystic Pop-up Bar tells the story of a mysterious pojangmacha (outdoor drinking establishment) run by an ill-tempered woman named Wol-joo, an innocent part-time employee named Han Kang-bae, and a former afterlife detective known as Chief Gwi who visit customers in their dreams to help resolve their problems.


This was a somewhat more light-hearted and comedic follow-up to watching [Crash Landing On You](/vizmedia/crash-landing-on-you). However it still had quite the sweet and sappy romance here too, which I wasn't expecting but worked well enough. (Didn't help those lonely feelings any though.) I really enjoyed the characters and the setup of the afterlife environment. I'd also say I enjoyed it more overall than [The Good Place](/vizmedia/the-good-place) too.
