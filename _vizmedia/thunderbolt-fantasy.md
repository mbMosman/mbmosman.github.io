This is super cool!  It's a TV series done with Taiwanese puppetry. I was totally amazed by the detail in the puppets and the amount of expression given to them in the puppetry.

While the talent in the puppetry and design is incredible, the story and characters in this are pretty awesome too. My favorite is the mysterious Lüè Fēng Qiè Chén (掠風竊塵) aka Ryō Fū Setsujin, the Thief of the Wind Dust, or as Crunchyroll translates it the Enigmatic Gale. He's clever and manipulative, and I'm never really sure if he is a *good guy* or is just waiting for his chance to pull one over on his companions.

I will admit to having a terrible time trying to get the character names straight as I hear them in Japanese and then see them as Chinese names in the subtitles. Perhaps the true problem though is not having a clue on how to pronounce Chinese names...

Anyhow, the whole thing is amazing. It's one of the coolest things I've seen, and I'm glad to see it back for season 2 with a 3rd season planned.
