OK, so first episodes in and I was sold. Distopian futures aren't really my thing, but I've always had a soft spot for mecha anime. I was pleasantly surprised. This is the best thing I've seen in quite some time. It's probably a good thing it was a week night, or I might have binged the whole darn thing. As it was, I went four episodes in and it was oh so hard to stop for bedtime.

The animation is top notch and the story is well done too. We dive in quick with a good bit of character drama, action, and awesome plot setup. The cast is both portrayed as diverse, and the voice actors themselves are too. The voice acting is also top notch with David Tennant (Dr. Who), Maise Williams (Arya, Game of Thrones), Dakota Fanning (wee Rachel, War of the Worlds), Koichi Yamadera (Spike, Cowboy Bepop), Gray Haddock (the English Sanosuke, Ruroni Kenshin), and others I didn't know before looking them up, or after (forgive me, I live in a box), but that makes them no less awesome. ^.^ 

Favorite quotes for inspiration:

> Needless agression, unscrupulous greed, unchecked hate... To have the images the headlines incessantly thrust at you, hour after hour, years at a time. You normalized it. They want you to go numb, become indifferent, or lose yourself in distractions. For it to feel like the evil in this world and all its machinations are too big to challenge. That lose of control leads to despair, to re-engage, to claw back even the tiniest sense of control... you don't have to save the world, you just have to make a difference where you can, with the opportunities you are given.
> ~ Dr. Rufus Weller

> Kazu Iida: How do you solve evil?    
> Julian Chase: You can't, but you can step up when you see it.
