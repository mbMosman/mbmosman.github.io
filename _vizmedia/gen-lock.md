OK, so first episodes in and I was sold. The animation is top notch and the story is well done too. We dive in quick with a good bit of character drama, action, and awesome plot setup. I'm looking forward to getting more of this. It will definitely get some rewatches as I share it out.

Oh, and the opening theme is __totally awesome!!!__ It's now my current fav tune.  Check it out!

Distopian futures aren't really my thing, but I've always had a soft spot for mecha anime. I didn't have high expectations, but was pleasantly surprised by this. It is the best thing I've seen in quite some time, and it's not Japanese! It's probably a good thing it was a week night that I started watching, or I might have binged the whole darn thing (only 8 episodes). As it was, I went four episodes in and it was oh so hard to stop for bedtime.

The cast is portrayed as diverse, and the [voice actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen:Lock#Main_cast) are too. They are also top notch - __David Tennant__ (Dr. Who), __Maise Williams__ (Arya, Game of Thrones), __Dakota Fanning__ (wee Rachel, War of the Worlds), __Koichi Yamadera__ (Spike, Cowboy Bepop), __Gray Haddock__ (the English Sanosuke, Ruroni Kenshin), and others I didn't know before looking them up. Or for some even after (forgive me, I live in a box), but that makes them no less awesome. ^.^ 

Favorite quotes for inspiration:

> Needless agression, unscrupulous greed, unchecked hate... To have the images the headlines incessantly thrust at you, hour after hour, years at a time. You normalized it. They want you to go numb, become indifferent, or lose yourself in distractions. For it to feel like the evil in this world and all its machinations are too big to challenge. That lose of control leads to despair, to re-engage, to claw back even the tiniest sense of control... you don't have to save the world, you just have to make a difference where you can, with the opportunities you are given.   
> ~ Dr. Rufus Weller

> Kazu Iida: How do you solve evil?    
> Julian Chase: You can't, but you can step up when you see it.

Don't you feel the warm fuzzies now?
