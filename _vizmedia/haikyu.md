> Summary: 
> Inspired by a small-statured pro volleyball player, Hinata creates a volleyball team in his last year of middle school. Unfortunately the team is matched up against the "King of the Court" Tobio Kageyama’s team in their first tournament and inevitably lose. After the crushing defeat, Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama After entering high school, Hinata joins the volleyball team only to find that Tobio has also joined.

This was recommended to me a few years ago, but I had so many other things on my plate that I dropped off after about 3 episodes, but it's been lingering in the back of my mind as something that might be cool to come back to later. I'm now watching it again and got pulled in pretty quickly. Volleyball & sports are not my thing, but the characters are great and it's cool to watch them learn how to come together as a team. 

Now that I've *finished* this, I find myself looking for more. I miss the team's upbeat and positive attitude. What they can't do now, they fully believe they can with a bit more practice and training. ^.^ I love that spirit.
