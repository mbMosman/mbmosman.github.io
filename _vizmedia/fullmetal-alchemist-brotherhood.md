What I like the most about this story is that while it shows how one decision can change our life forever, it also shows how far one might go to try and make a bad outcome *right*. In addition to one's search for redemption, there's also the other side of forgiveness. It's quite a touching tale, mixed in with all the action and adventure.

There are two anime versions of this manga tale. This version covers the whole of the story from the manga, where as the earlier anime (just called Fullmetal Alchemist) only covers a portion of it before turning to an alternate ending. There are things I like about both, but in the end I think this is the better story.
