> Eleanor Shellstrop wakes up in the afterlife and is introduced by Michael to "the Good Place", a highly selective Heaven-like utopia he designed. This is a reward for her supposedly righteous life, but Eleanor quickly realizes there's been a mistake. She's not the good and selfless person they think she is. So she's hiding her morally sad behavior while learning to become a better, more ethical person.

I've heard so many people saying great things about this, so I decided to give it a go. Only a few episodes in and still somewhat undecided...
