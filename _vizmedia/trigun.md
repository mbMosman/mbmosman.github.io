Trigun is an interesting anime, as it leaves more questions unanswered, I think, than it answers. Yet it is full of action & adventure, awesome characters, and it's hard not to love Vash the Stampeed. Despite being wanted for causing vast destruction, it's not actually Vash doing the damage but rather those chasing after him for the bounty on his head - a rather interesting play on events. Vash himself aims for non-violence, wants to help people, and just see everyone happy. Will he ever get what he wants?
