> Yuri Katsuki carried the hope of all Japan on his shoulders in the Figure Skating Grand Prix, but suffered a crushing defeat in the finals. He returned to his hometown in Kyushu and hid away in his family's home, half wanting to continue skating and half wanting to retire. That was when the five-time consecutive world champion, Victor Nikiforov, suddenly showed up with his teammate, Yuri Plisetsky, a young skater starting to surpass his seniors. And so the two Yuris and the Russian champion Viktor set out to compete in a Grand Prix like none the world has ever seen!

This was an amazing anime. It probably doesn't hurt that my mom is a huge figure skating fan, so I've watched a lot of figure skating growing up. However I don't think you need to appreciate the sport to appreciate the anime. It's all about over coming challenges and chasing after your dreams - and maybe defeating a bit of imposter syndrome along the way. This anime has it all, great characters, great story, great music, and all the action, excitement and drama you could want with no violence involved. Oh, there's love too...
