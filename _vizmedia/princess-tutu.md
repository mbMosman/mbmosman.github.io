> A magical girl anime series inspired by ballet and fairy tales, particularly The Ugly Duckling and Swan Lake. The story follows a duck who is transformed into the mythical ballerina Princess Tutu in order to save the shattered heart of a storybook prince come to life.

So this is not at all what I would have expected... I mean it is cute and sweet, but it's also got a darker side that touches on so many very real conflicts of the heart. So many emotions! As Princess Tutu restores the prince's shattered heart, the emotions she gives back to him aren't so bright and cheery... It's quite a bit deeper than I ever would have given it credit for from the description and images.
