OK, so going into this blind, I was in for one hell of a surprise. Neverland, Peter Pan, cheery things, right? Nope, not so much... 

These orphans are being farmed as food for demons. Yes, that's a wee spoiler, but you find out in the first episode, so it's not a huge one. The show is surprisingly catching, as I was hooked right away at the end of that first episode. It's the orphans against Mother as they plot their escape with plot twists gallore. 

The first season ends on a mixed note, but avoids a total cliff hanger ending. I appreciate that. Rumor has it we will get another season next year. I don't think I love it enough to hop into the manga, but would watch more. There's definite potential for interesting happenings as the story moves forward.
