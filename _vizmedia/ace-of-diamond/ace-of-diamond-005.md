  Coach Kataoka, or "Shades" as Sawamura calls him, organizes a game between the first years and the non-starters on the second and third year teams. The goal is to determine who will join the starters for upcoming practice games. When Sawamura comes across Kataoka in the bath, the coach gives him one final chance to answer his question. After the answer is given, Sawamura is allowed into the upcoming game, but when he starts as an outfielder, it could spell doom for any chance he has on the varsity team.
