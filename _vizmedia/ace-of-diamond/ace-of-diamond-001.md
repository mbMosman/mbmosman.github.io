  Eijun Sawamura, the pitcher of a novice junior high baseball team, meets with a bitter walk-off loss. For Sawamura the loss becomes his last game in junior high, so he sets a new goal of going to the nationals in high school with his teammates. As he begins his hard quest on studying, a guest arrives unannounced. Her name is Rei Takashima. Rei had been watching his last game and believes Sawamura has a gift. She is the assistant director of the prestigious Seidou High School Baseball Team, and she invites Sawamura to Seido after seeing his potential. Sawamura's reply shocks her, but Takashima refuses to give up and tricks Sawamura into a visit.

It's a pretty good opening episode. Sets the stage really well for where things are headed. Introduces Sawmura as a nice guy who's not very bright, but enjoys having fun with his friends playing baseball. However he seems to be quite a bit more passionate about playing it than they are.
