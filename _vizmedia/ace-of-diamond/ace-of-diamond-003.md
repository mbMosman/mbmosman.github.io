  Eijun is nervous about rooming with older teammates, but they make him feel a too little at home on his first night. Eijun ends up oversleeping and shows up late when it's time to meet Coach Tesshina Kataoka, a former Japanese pro pitcher. Miyuki also shows up late, but he uses Sawamura as a decoy to sneak into his line. Kataoka shows no mercy and says Eijun can never become a pitcher if he can't show up on time. He also makes Miyuki run laps, as well as Eijun's two room mates for allowing him to oversleep. Sawamura is determined to prove he can be the ace though, so Coach Kataoka gives him a special challenge, saying until he can complete this challenge, he can't play in a baseball game for Seidou.
