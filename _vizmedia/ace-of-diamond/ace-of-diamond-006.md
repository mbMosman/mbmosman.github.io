  "Thanks to the words of fellow first year Haruichi Kominato, Eijun makes it on base. Next Haruichi promises to bring him home and get the first years a run. Haruichi proves to be a brilliant batter, and thanks to his spring Eijun scores. However the first years quickly get three outs, and Coach Kataoka says he will call it a game unless all the first years agree to continue. Most want to drop out, but thanks to words of encouragement from Eijun they decide to continue. Eijun is placed on the mound, and Hariuchi is placed at shortstop. The two seem to be working effectively together against the older students until Eijun's upperclassman roommate Masuko comes to the plate. Can Eijun find a way to strike out his roommate, who is the #5 hitter for the JV team?"

This was a really good episode as it shows that there's more to Eijun than just a lot of yelling and some wild pitching. He's got the spirit to pull the team together and out of a slump. We saw that spirit at the start with his middle school friends, but it's nice to see that he hasn't lost that sense of team importance now that he's on a mission to become the HS Ace.
