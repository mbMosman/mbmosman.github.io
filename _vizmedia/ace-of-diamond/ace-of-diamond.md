Martin and I are now doing a Friday anime night and this was one of his picks. We had started to watch it a while ago as a suggestion from Christy, but after a few episodes put it aside. Now we're picking it up again. It's not so bad, but that kid sure is loud... 

Well, we got through a bit of it, but it's slow moving in many ways. Martin's not really into the school thing, and I'm not really into the sports thing. We probably won't be finishing this one, though I'll admit to having found it more endearing than I initially expected. However, we've moved on to other things for anime night, so I probably will not be finishing this one.
