> During the chaotic Northern and Southern Dynasties, in Northern Liang's royal family lived a princess named Feng Xin'er (Tiffany Tang) who was kind, carefree and loved by all. Chiyun Nan, a marshal from the Chiyun clan of Northern Wei, takes it upon himself to overrun Northern Liang for his greed and turned it into a bloodbath, killing almost the entire royal family and forcing the princess to survive on her own.
>
>Li Wei yang, the daughter of the Prime Minister of Northern Wei, shielded the princess from harm. However, Weiyang dies protecting Xin'er due to the fact that the Chiyun family is not pleased when it is time to recall her back to their family manor, and the latter (Xin'er) assumes Weiyoung's identity to reside in her home, where she is disliked and shunned by her half-sister Li Changle and her mother Chiyun Rou. She thus took it upon herself to fight against the Chiyun clan and unexpectedly, became entangled with Northern Wei's prince, Tuoba Jun (Luo Jin). 

I got sucked down a hole with binge-watching this too, and more than 50 with 45 min episodes, it is quite the investment. Some of the plot and characters are a bit cliche, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's definitely dramatic, but makes for a good way to unwind and relax for a few hours. 

I am quite fond of the main character Weiyoung and her cousin Minde. The princes are also interesting, but the princess Di is way more fun as she pretends to be a prince and hassles Minde. There is definitely soap-opera drama, romance, and back-stabbing, but the craziness is entertaining. I can't say that some of it isn't a bit extreme or illogical, but if it's entertaining, that's all that matters here.
