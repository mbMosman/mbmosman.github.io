> The jianghu world is ruled by the powerful Wen sect, which dominates over the smaller Lan, Jiang, Nie and Jin sects. The carefree Wei Wuxian becomes fast friends with the righteous Lan Wangji, and during their adventures, the pair find out that the head of the Wen sect is the evil mastermind behind a series of plots that would wreak havoc upon the lands.

> Wei Wuxian's attempts to protect the innocent members of the Wen sect from unfair persecution lead to disaster, and he goes missing in the process. Wei Wuxian reappears sixteen years later, and works together with Lan Wangji to solve a series of murder mysteries, eventually finding and defeating the true culprit.

Netflix said I would like it, and while I initially found it a little hard to sort out what was going on, by the second episode I was hooked. I totally binged these 50 (45 min) episodes in over just over a week, typically 4-3 at a time.  

This was beautiful and adventurous, with some great music & a hint of mystery. Not to mention the cats loved it because it generated prime lap space for great periods of time. I've gotta find more like this...
