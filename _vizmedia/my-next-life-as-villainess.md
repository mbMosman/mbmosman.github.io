> Wealthy heiress Catarina Claes is hit in the head with a rock and recovers the memories of her past life. It turns out the world she lives in is the world of the game Fortune Lover, an otome game she was obsessed with in her past life... but she's been cast as the villain character who tries to foil the protagonist's romances! The best ending the game has for Catarina is exile, and the worst, death! She'll have to find a way to avoid triggering the flags of doom, and make her own happy future! The misunderstanding-based screwball love comedy now begins!

I wasn't sure what to make of this at first. It seemed like a pretty juvenile idea - getting sucked into a dating game as the vilainess. However I ended up liking it more than I intended too. It was nothing super special or memorable, but it was quite cute and entertaining. The characters ended up being rather endearing.
