Totally binged this and loved it. I wasn't really sure what to make of it initially, as frankly I just loved the closing theme of "Other Side" from Miyavi, so I discovered this accidentally from that connection. It sounded interesting and didn't disappoint. I don't know that I'd watch it again, but it was a great distraction from all the things right now.
