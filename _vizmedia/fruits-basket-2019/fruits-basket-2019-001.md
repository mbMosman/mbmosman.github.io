On her way to school, she sees a house and out of curiousity peeks at zodiac figurines sitting outside. Her classmate Yuki Sohma lives there with his cousin Shigure, the house's owner. Yuki and Tohru walk to school together, causing Tohru to be harassed by some of Yuki's admirers. She is saved by her friends Arisa Uotani and Saki Nakajima. Later that night, Yuki and Shigure are walking home and see Tohru returning to the tent. After hearing her story, they offer to let her stay temporarily with them in exchange for housework.

It's so awesome to be watching this again! I'm so excited to see the full story animated!!!  

I also just starting to re-read the manga from the recently published collectors edition, and it's nice that this time around the anime is sticking much closer to the story from the manga. The biggest difference so far is a little baseball cap that keeps popping up along with a memory Tohru has of a little boy putting it on her head. We'll learn more about this cap as the story continues, and it ends up having a lot of significance, but I didn't recall it at all from the previous anime series. This seems to imply that this one will go a little deeper, sicking closer to the original story. I'm looking forward to that, but it'll be interesting to see if all the Fruits Basket fans appreciate that or not.
