Yay! Fruits Basket lives again! I'm excited for this new version of the anime as it is meant to follow the full story from the manga (which the earlier Fruits Basket anime production did not). Woot! I can't wait to meet __*all*__ the characters this time!

Christy and I kicked off our Spring 2019 anime watching with the first two episodes and while I wasn't as keen on the new skinny art look, the story was familiar and as endearing as ever. It's cool that this seems to stick a little closer to the manga story and go a little deeper perhaps into the storylines of Tohru & our Sohma zodiac. There are already some little sneak peeks at what is to come - for example a little baseball cap is popping up here and there, which has significance we'll learn about later on. Seeing this again makes me __*so*__ happy!!!

Alas, the first season is over. Sigh... But this time I know the story will continue! It was so awesome to finally see the fuller manga story filled out in anime. I should have expected the first season to end in the same place as that original anime, but for whatever reason I didn't. This version however didn't feel nearly as rushed and awkwardly squished in the end as the earlier version. It's a great pause point, ready for a new beginning.
