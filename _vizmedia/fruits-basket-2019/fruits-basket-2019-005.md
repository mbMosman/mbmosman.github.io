  Tohru announces that the renovations at her grandfather's house have been completed, and would be moving back in the next day. Her decision leaves the Sohmas seemingly in agreement that her stay with them was only a temporary circumstance. The next day, Tohru arrives back at her grandfather's place and is greeted by her relatives whom he was staying with. Later Tohru's aunt reveals that she had known about Tohru's living arrangement with the Sohmas thanks to a private detective and is concerned that this (including Kyoko's violent past) would negatively affect her son's ambitions to become a police officer. The discussion comes to a head when Tohru's grandfather slaps the son following his jeers at her, and the grandfather allows Tohru to live freely (as her parents had done) if she wants. Tohru breaks down as she truthfully reveals that she wants to spend more time with the Sohmas. Yuki and Kyo, who were both listening in from the outside after being bothered by Tohru's leaving, arrive to take Tohru back to their home. Yuki tells off the aunt's son for his meanness to Tohru, while Kyo tells Tohru that it is alright to be selfish once in a while, causing Tohru to remember her mother giving her the exact same advice when she was young. Thus Tohru joyfully moves back in with the Sohmas.

This is another of my favorite episodes as Tohru finds the home she's always wanted. Having just recently read through this in the manga, this again is sticking much closer to the details from the original writing. While I do think that's pretty cool, I also miss some of the freedom they had to re-imagine the details in the original anime. Afterall not *all* the details are important, but maybe then that's just the me who is realizing it will take another season or so to get to the parts of the story we didn't see initially...
