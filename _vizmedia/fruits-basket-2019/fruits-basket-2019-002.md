  The episode starts with Shigure explaining that he, Yuki and Kyo, and others in the Soma family are possessed by the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, causing them to transform whenever they feel weak, stressed or are embraced by someone of the opposite sex. Although Tohru promises to keep the Somas' family secret, Yuki is concerned that the family head, Akito, will have her memory will be erased to protect their secret. Shigure also says that Kyo will be living with them. He tricked Kyo into taking the transfer exam for their high school, so they'll also all be in school together. At school the next day, Yuki tells Tohru her memory might be erased. She says it is ok's, but asks him to make friends with her again. Kyo jumps out the 2nd floor window to escape all the attention from his classmates, and Yuki finds him hiding out and another fight nearly breaks out, but Tohru stops them, again accidentally turning Kyo into a cat. He yells, at her and she leaves. Later, he walks her home and tries to appologize.
