  For the school cultural festival, they're going to have a rice ball stand. Kyo is mad that the class rejected his idea and latched onto Yuki's instead. He tells Tohru that he envies Yuki not just for being part of the zodiac, but for being smart and respected by others. After class, Kyo is baited into playing cards (Rich Man - Poor Man) by Uo, and Yuki sees them having fun and later tells Tohuru he is envious of Kyo's ability to interact and get along so easily with everyone. The next morning as Tohru is making rice balls for the school festival, she tries to use the plum on the back of the rice ball as an analogy for why people see the good qualities of others, but can't see the good qualities in themselves - like the plum on a rice ball it's on their back.

This is one of my favorite bits of this story as it is just so perfect. That Kyo and Yuki are constantly fighting while both being envious of the other is so relatable, and the rice ball analogy, while completely cheesey is also just so perfect for the story. Then of course there's Kyo, telling Tohru that he can see the plum on her back, but it's just a teeny-tiny little one... It's definitely a top anime moment.
