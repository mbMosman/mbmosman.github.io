  In this episode, we meet Kagura Sohma who shows up at the house looking for Kyo. At first she seems quiet and shy, but then all her emotions burst out as she pummels him. She says that she's Kyo's fiancee, but Kyo doesn't go along saying that was under threatening cirumstances when they were kids. To prove her love Kagura insists on cooking dinner, but her feast is ruined when Kyo refuses to join and Kagura loses her temper, ruining more of Sigure's house. Kagura goes the the store to get more food, leaving her purse/money behind, but Tohru follows and buys the groceries. They talk on the way back and cook hamburgers together. While Kagura still sees her as a rival, they become friends.

Kagura isn't my favorite character. In many ways she's like Hatsuharu (who we haven't met yet in the anime), but for some reason, I can tolerate him, but not her. Maybe that's a cultural thing - we can tolerate temper in men but not women? I don't know, maybe it isn't the temper and violence, maybe it's the obsessive, clingy *love*. She's definitely an extreme character, but maybe bits of that hit too close to home or something. 

Anyhow, I suppose because of that, this isn't one of my favorite episodes. However there are some interesting bits to it. She mentions something of Kyo's *true form*, which he quickly cuts off. That plants some seeds for later. It's also sweet how Tohru tells Kagura that she wants to be more like her, to see all the good things about people she likes. You can see that Kagura has never had someone say anything like that to her. It's quite touching.

While the storyline of this episode generally mirrors the earlier anime, they differ quite a bit in the details. This new version sticks a lot closer to the manga original. I do however miss the little scene with the cat and mouse shaped patches to the paper screens.
