  The rice ball stand at the school festival is a success, mainly due to Yuki reluctantly cross-dressing at the third year girls' insistence. Momiji and Hatori Sohma also visit the stand. Momiji causes chaos when he hugs Tohru and transforms into a rabbit, but Yuki serves as a distraction to save the day. Yuki warns Tohru to not be alone with Hatori, as he is the doctor who wipes people's memories. After the festival ends, Tohru's best friends Uo and Hana confront her about her close relationship with Yuki, and Tohru inadvertently reveals that she is living with them. To decide if they are OK with this, they invite themselves to a sleepover. When they lament that they weren't there to help Tohru, Yuki and Kyo remind them that Tohru is the type of person who would ask for help. As they are heading to bed, we learn the significance of the baseball cap that keeps popping up. Tohru tells Uo and Hana how she was saved and guided home by a young boy, after being chased by bullies and getting lost. The episode ends as Tohru gets a phone call from Hatori, asking her to come by and see him alone.

While Momiji comes across as quite annoying at first, he's the sunshine of the Sohmas and one of my favorite among them. 

I love the friendship that Tohru, Uo and Hana share. Their bond really comes through in this episode in a way that is believable despite being pretty sugar coated. It also shows that Yuki and Kyo are really getting to know the *real* Tohru, even though they haven't been together very long.
