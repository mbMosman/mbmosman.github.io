> Kei Toume's eighteen-year youth ensemble classic gets its long-awaited animated adaptation. A story of love and humanity, following four boys and girls trying to live their best lives through hardship and turmoil, in a small town on a private rail line just outside of Shinjuku. Minor misunderstandings lead to big complications, and their various feelings become entangled. A story of daily life lived 49% looking back, 51% looking forward.

This was my favorite new anime of the spring. It had great, relatable characters with relationships that felt genuine and real. They had their ups and downs, did the things they thought they should, then did the things their hearts told them they should. It also built suspense throughout, as I was never really sure who would end up with whom, or how much the surrounding characters might intermingle and get involved. Sometimes the end can be disappointing if things don't work out the way you might like, but here I was hoping for a different outcome but was happy to see things work out the way that they did.
