Ruroni Kenshin was one of the first anime that I watched. I recall anxiously expecting each new DVD release and have watched particularly the first two-seasons (and select excerpts from it) more times than I can count. While it's a truly tough call to say this, I think I would say that Kenshin's story (crossing both this series & Samurai X) is definitely my all time anime/manga story, and I'd perhaps take that further and say just all time favorite story *period*. It certainly sparked my interest in anime, as well as Japanese history & culture, but at heart it is a tale of redemption and hope. There's a spirit of optimism and faith in humanity underlying the story that I want to believe in and keep returning too. 

These particular OVA's are less *cute* and much more dramatic and violent than the what you'll find in [Ruroni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story](/vizmedia/ruroni-kenshin.html). This is Kenshin's backstory, from his youth through his days fighting through the Meiji Revolution as a killer. He's fighting for a change that he believes is right, and plays an important role in bringing about what he considers change for the better, yet it also takes a toll on him, particularly as he sees more clearly the price others pay for his actions. It's an amazingly touching and tragic story of trust, betrayal, and forgiveness.
