> In the world of Radiant, monsters called Nemeses fall from the sky. These Nemeses contaminate everything they touch. People who survive their contact become cursed, but also gain the ability to wield the magic power known as "Fantasia", thus becoming Sorcerers. Seth, the protagonist of Radiant, is a teenage boy who has survived a Nemesis attack. He dreams of defeating all of the Nemeses and bringing peace between Sorcerers and the rest of humanity. To do so, he has to find the place where the Nemeses come from, the legendary Radiant, and destroy it. He and other sorcerers travel the region in search of Radiant whilst avoiding the Inquisition, an organization opposed to Sorcerers.
