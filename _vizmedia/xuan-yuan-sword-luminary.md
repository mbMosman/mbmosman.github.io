This is an interesting and action packed show based on a series of Taiwanese RPGs. The story is about childhood friends who's peaceful life is interrupted by war, and they end up split working on opposite sides. Zhao ends up building war machines for the Taibai Empire, after befriending the young Empress. Ning and Yin try to continue living as best they can, but the war chases them until they eventually end up fighting with the Resistance agains the Empire. It's full of drama and a bit of a roller coaster of emotions, but it's got a decent set of characters and the plot has enoungh little twists in it to make it less predictable and more interesting.
