> Crash Landing on You tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean Chaebol heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), a member of the North Korean elite and a Captain in the North Korean Special Police Force.

This was great fun to watch. It might be my first Korean drama... I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I really liked that they had a several stories going here all wrapped up together. I totally binged it, but beware the episodes are over an hour long. I didn't realize this at first and had many a long night. 

It was sweet and super romantic. The only downside here was that it made me feel super lonely. :-(  I cried tears of both tears of joy and sorrow (for them & me) before it was all over.
