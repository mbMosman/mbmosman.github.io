  After the battle with Akutagawa, Atsushi wakes up on the Agency's clinic. Kunikida warns Atsushi that there's a big bounty on him and that the Port Mafia attack the Agency to capture him. He suggests that Atshushi think what he can do before things go bad. Atsushi takes that to mean he should turn himself in to save the Agency. The Port Mafia's Black Lizard Squad (Tachihara, Hirotsu, and Gin) attack while Atsushi is on his way to surrender, meaning they were going to do it anyway. However he hears the attack and returns to the Agency just in time to see the Agency folks have everything under control.  When he realizes they weren't in any danger and that his surrender isn't what Kunikida was suggesting, he gets all teary. It looks like he's found a home.

Again, it really makes you feel for Atsushi that he's so used to people not caring about him that he can't imagine anything else. I almost got teary myself at the end when he realized that they didn't mean he should leave. The bad guys seem __*bad*__ but yet the agency defeats them so easily... Why not send the big bad Akutagawa? What are the other Agency members powers?  Inquiring minds want to know!
