  Kunikida and Atsushi try to get Kyouka to talk, but she wants boiled tofu first, so Atsushi agrees and he ends up buying. After, Kunikida reminds him that she's many people and is currently being wanted by the government. Instead of turning her in however, Atsushi takes her on a date all around the city, but the last place she asks to go is the police station to turn herself in. Before that can happen though, the Port Mafia and Akutagawa arrive and capture them both. The Agency hears that Atsushi was captured and starts a hunt for him. Meanwhile, Dazai is still a prisioner of the Port Mafia and has been taunting Akutagawa. At the end, another character Chuuya shows up.

Again, Atsushi is trying to save others at his own expense. Kunikida tells him there's only room for one on his boat, and if he tries to save another, they'll both end up drowning. However Atsushi isn't swayed, after all Dazai saved him. 

We aslo learn a bit more about Dazai, who was apparently a pretty important figure before turning traitor and joining the Agency. He used to be Akutagawa's boss, and taunts him by saying that Atsushi is a better subordinate. It'll be interesting to see who Chuuya is what Dazai is up to.
