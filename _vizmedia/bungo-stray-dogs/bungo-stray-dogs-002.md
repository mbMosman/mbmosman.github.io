  Atsushi decides to look for a job and Dazai offers to help him when they bump Kunikida who tells them about an emergency situation where man has taken a hostage and is threatening to blow up the building. Atsushi is dressed up as a paper boy to distract the bomber, giving Dazai enough time to subdue him. However, the man still presses the detonator and the bomb starts counting down. Seeing no other way to save the others, Atsushi throws himself over the bomb. Howver the bomb doesn't go off. It was all a test to see if Atsushi had the right character to become a member of the Agency. The President leaves the decision to Dazai, and so Atsushi formally becomes a member of the Armed Detective Agency.

Another great episode. Atsushi definities won me over with his save the others routine, but at the same time you feel for him so much! While yes, he wanted to save the others, it also shows just how little he values himself. That side of it is quite sad, though it seems Dazai is little better. It'll be interesting to get more of his story and see where this relationship between the two of them goes.

Near the beginning, it seemed like I was able to recognize bits from a lot of the conversation in Japanese, so I thought I'd try to use this as a mini Japanese lesson. I took some extra effort through the intro to try and write out what I thought they were saying, character by character and then try translating that back in Google Translate. Wow, was that ever hard!!! Turns out that while I can generally recognize sayings, I'm terrible at actually hearing the characters correctly. The short intro took me about 30 minutes and I gave up before the end. >.<

Anyhow, I think it's actually a good idea, and maybe I can work up to it a bit more. I've been getting out of the habit of studying as I get pulled into more and more things at work and home, and I certainly don't want to start forgetting things!
