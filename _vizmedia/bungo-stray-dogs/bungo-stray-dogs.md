Supernatural dectective work takes center stage with some very interesting characters. It quickly sucked me in with the characters odd-ball nature and the gang of misfits theme. I'm jumping into this a little late, as they are into their 3rd season, but I can see why it would be popular. 

I didn't realize this at first, but many of the characters and their powers are named after literary figures and their works. That's pretty sweet!

I got about 20 episodes in the first time through, then got distracted by other things, now Martin and I are watching this for our anime night. He seems to like it so far. Woot!
