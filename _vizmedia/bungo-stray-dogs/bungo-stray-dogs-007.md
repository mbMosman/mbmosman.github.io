  This continues the Azure Messenger story from the previous episode. In this episode, Kunikida, Dazai, and Atsushi are trying to track down a bomb that is going to kill many people at the end of the day. Dazai seems to be flirting with their rescued victim instead of working, which makes Kunikida angry, but perhaps it is all a ploy. Ranpo returns to help them pin-point the bomb location, but the bomb cannot be disarmed in time, meaning they need to find those responsible and get a remote signal sent to shut it down. Kunikida's kid informant Rakuzou tracks supplies to a military base, where it also happens that the taxi driver was found dead. They spread over and a battle ensues with a boy whose ability allows him to control people marked with numbers until the number counts down to 00 which causes them to die. Dazai & Kunikida defeat the enemies their, and the bomb is disabled. We also get to see Kunikida and Dazai working as a well choreographed pair. In the end, the rescued victim turns out to be the one they are after, acting to revenge her former boyfriend, the Azure King.

Mystery solved, though it seems that Rakuzou was also killed at the end. It was cool to see Kunikida and Dazai in action. Atsushi has been questioning their partnership, but they seem to be well in-tune to each other. At the end however, Dazai is questioning Kunikida's devotion to his ideals, seeming to imply that they will destroy him similar to how the Azure King was taken out in pursuit of his own ideals.
