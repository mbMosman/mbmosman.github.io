  In the aftermath of Atsushi and Dazai's abduction, the Agency must decide what to do with Kyouka, the loose end. Meanwhile the Port Mafia also deliberates what to do with Akutagawa, now comatose as his enemies seek Vengence.

Kyouka saving Atsushi at her own expense makes her seem much more genuine. Interesting to see another with the same or similar powers. I guess they are not all unique... It was also great to see that Higuchi is loyal to Akutagawa, even though he seems to have little *need* of her. Also nice to see that when she gets into trouble, the rest of the gang was there to rescue her when she thought she was all alone and it was all over.
