  We learn that Chuuya was formerly Dazai's partner and discover that Dazai had setup his capture with some security that means Chuuya can't kill him. He tells Dazai where to find the information he wants and in exchange Dazai won't make is seem like Chuuya facilitated his escape. Atsushi and Akutagawa battle it out, and Atsushi's strength is starting to show. He does more than just fend off Akutagawa, and defeats him in the end but is badly wounded and unconcious. Kyouka drags him to saftey where Kunikia is waiting to take them back.

Dazai and Chuuya turn out to have been partners. Dazai has setup his capture to learn about where Atsushi's bounty came from. Cool to see that he does seem to care about this stray he's picked up. It seems another group of ability users, the Guild is about to enter the stage. Things are getting interesting...
