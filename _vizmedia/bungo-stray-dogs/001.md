  Nakajima Atsushi, a starving, homeless orphan, sees a man drowning in the river and dives in to rescues the man, intending to rob him. However, the man regains consciousness and introduces himself Osamu Dazi. (He's apparently trying different methods of suicide, but never seems to end up dead.) Seeing that the boy is starving, he and his collegue, Doppo Kunikida, they treat Atsushi to a meal. Atsushi discovers that they work for the Armed Detective Agency, and are searching for a tiger that has been ravaging the area. Atsushi tells them that the tiger has been following him. It was the reason he was kicked out of the orphanage. Dazai persuades him to act as bait to help them capture the tiger, but it turns out that Atsushi is actually the tiger. While they are staked out, he transforms in the moonlight and attacks. Dazai stops him with his special ability, "No Longer Human", which cancels any other ability when he touches that person. The episode ends as the others show up and Dazai offers to make Atsushi a member of the Agency.

Great first episode. It sucks you right in as it introduces the main characters and pulls you into the story. Some of the characters can be a little annoying at first, particularly the suicidal Dazai, but the idea of it wins out. I wanna see where this story is gonna go.
