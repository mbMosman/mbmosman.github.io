  A lady requests help from the agency to deal with some some suspicious characters, assumed to be smugglers. Atsushi and two others, Juichiro & Naomi. Before they go Kunikida warns Atsushi about the area's big bad guy - Akutagawa, a member of Port Mafia. Once they arrive on the scene, the woman reveals herself as, Higuchi Ichuyou, a member of Port Mafia and attacks them. Naomi is injured as she tries to protect her brother, Junichirō, who retaliates with his ablilty "Light Snow". However Akutagawa appears and defeats him. Atsushi isn't harmed, as it was all a trap to capture Atsushi, the weretiger. Atsushi transforms and they fight until Dazai shows up and cancels both powers with "No Longer Human". While Atsushi is out, Akutagawa reveals that Dazai used to be a member of Port Mafia.

Yet another great episode. It wasn't too surprising to discover that Dazai was once part of the Port Mafia, as they had earlier been trying to guess his previous profession because no one knew. That made me think that it is was likely disreputable, my guess being former gangster. Well, guess it doesn't need to be unpredictable...
