  In this episode we meet another member of the Agency, Ranpo, whose special ability, "Super Deduction", allows him to instantly solve a case. They go to the scene of a murder to find the local police there, where the victim is revolves a policewoman. Ranpo challenges one of the officers to solve the murder in 60 seconds, and then when the time is up, he makes the big reveal that the officer himself was the murderer. Dazai shows up on the scene too, and walking back explains to Atsushi that Ranpo doesn't really have a *power*, he solves cases with pure deduction and reasoning. Atsushi asks how that's possible, and Dazai explains that he sorted out some of the facts too, but that even he is impressed with Ranpo's ability.

Cool to see another member of the Agency and their *powers* or abilities, even if it isn't supernatural. It's interesting that Ranpo wants to believe he has a supernatural ability when really he's just smart. Maybe that doesn't seem as cool? Excited to learn more about this group of misfits.
