  This starts out with Kunikida, Dazai and Atsushi looking into a case of missing tourists. An informant, Rokuzou who Kunikida seems to be looking out for following his father's death, tips them off to an abandoned hospital and they take a cab, driven by another informat out there to check it out. One of the victims, a lady in nothing but her underwear, is found almost drowning in a water tank. Kunikida is able to save her, but they don't make it to the other prisoners in time and they who are gassed. This makes the Agency and specifically Kunikida look bad. Turns out that the taxi driver was responsible for the kidnappings, but wasn't in it alone. He asks for protection in exchange for being a witness, as one of the victims was a member of the Port Mafia. The tip offs are coming from someone called the Azure Messenger, and apparently he's related to events of the Azure King - a bombinf from the past which killed Rokuzou's father. The story line continues into the next episode.

Mystery here... This episode feels a little deeper as it leaves you wondering about Kunikida's past and his sense of responsibility for Rokuzou and the earlier events. Sometimes the characters come across as pretty juvenile and incapable, so this kinda gives him a bit more depth. This is the first incident that hasn't really been wrapped up in a single episode, so that also gives things a bit more gravity.
