  Atsushi is taken shopping by the Agency doctor, Akiko Yosano. On their return, their train is subject to a terrorist bombing by the Port Mafia to again capture Atsushi. Yosano heads to the front of the train where she encounters the bomber, Kaiji Motojirou. While Atsushi heads to the back where he meets the young assassin Izumi Kyouka and is nearly defeated by her ability "Demon Snow". His ability saves him, but it turns out Kyouka is wearing the bomb. She tries to jump off the train to prevent killing anyone else, and Atsushi jumps after her, using his power to rip off the vest and save her. Yosano also defeats Kaiji, but as the episode ends we see that Dazi is Akutakawa's prisoner.

Cool to see that Atsushi is gaining some mastery of his own ability. The plot thickens...  What will happen next with this girl Atsushi "saved", will she switch sides?  What about Dazai? Does anyone even realize he may be in trouble?
