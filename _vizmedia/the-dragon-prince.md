Wow. I'm really impressed by this show. First, it's a great story with some pretty awesome characters. On top of that though, it's probably the most amazingly inclusive cast of characters that I've ever seen. It's wonderful to see! The story is well done, and there's some awesome messages tucked in there too. This has quickly become a favorite.
