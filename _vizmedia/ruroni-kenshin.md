Ruroni Kenshin was one of the first anime that I watched. I recall anxiously expecting each new DVD release and have watched particularly the first two-seasons (and select excerpts from it) more times than I can count. While it's a truly tough call to say this, I think I would say that Kenshin's story (crossing both this series & Samurai X) is definitely my all time anime/manga story, and I'd perhaps take that further and say just all time favorite story *period*. It certainly sparked my interest in anime, as well as Japanese history & culture, but at heart it is a tale of redemption and hope. There's a spirit of optimism and faith in humanity underlying the story that I want to believe in and keep returning too.
