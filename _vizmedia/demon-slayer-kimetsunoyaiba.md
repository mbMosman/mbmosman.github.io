> It is the Taisho Period in Japan. Tanjiro, a kindhearted boy who sells charcoal for a living, finds his family slaughtered by a demon. To make matters worse, his younger sister Nezuko, the sole survivor, has been transformed into a demon herself. Though devastated by this grim reality, Tanjiro resolves to become a “demon slayer” so that he can turn his sister back into a human, and kill the demon that massacred his family.

This was a recommendation of sorts, it popped up with the question of what else has been good this year. It's got an interesting premise and start to it, but I haven't gotten very far in yet. It was OK, but didn't really grab me.
