> Summary:  
> It is the Taisho Period in Japan. Tanjiro, a kindhearted boy who sells charcoal for a living, finds his family slaughtered by a demon. To make matters worse, his younger sister Nezuko, the sole survivor, has been transformed into a demon herself. Though devastated by this grim reality, Tanjiro resolves to become a “demon slayer” so that he can turn his sister back into a human, and kill the demon that massacred his family.

This was a recommendation of sorts, it popped up with the question of what else has been good this year. I'm glad I dove in though, as it turned out to be pretty awesome. I felt like it had a rather slow start, but once I hit somewhere around episode 10, I was hooked. It's an exciting sword fighting action/adventure, and a sweet story of sibling bonds, with a bit of mystery and the supernatural mixed in.
