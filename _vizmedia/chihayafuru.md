> Chihaya Ayase's life changes when she meets a boy named Arata Wataya, a talented karuta player, in school. After becoming friends, he believes that Chihaya has potential to become a great player. The frieds are separated as they grow up, and Chihaya takes on a new dream of becoming Japan's best karuta player to be reunited with them. In high school, Chihaya, with her childhood friend Taichi Mashima, form the Mizusawa Karuta Club. With her teammates and friends supporting her, Chihaya strives to become the best karuta player in the world to one day be with Arata again.

I adored the first two seasons of this, and have been patiently waiting to learn what will happen next. The tone of this 3rd season is fittingly different, as it is more focused on Chihaya's fight to the top and her team's fight to improve to support her. While it is great to see the team coming together, and fighting their own battles to improve their game, I do miss some of the lighter moments of the earlier seasons. The later half of this 3rd season brings back some of those lighter moments. Woot!
