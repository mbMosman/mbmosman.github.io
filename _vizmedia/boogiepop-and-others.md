This was a weekend binge watch, though it turned out to be a bit longer than I had expected at 18 episodes. It's an interesting story idea, and it's presented in quite an interesting way as well. The story isn't entirely linear, hopping around a bit in time, and it is carefully woven through a gradually expanding cast. 

The anime is based on a light novel, which I think shows through in the writing and presentation. They do a good job of splitting it into a handful of smaller stories, split across the episodes, but it still has the feel of a work that came together as a whole vs one put together in parts over a longer period of time. It's really well done, and is quite a fun story.
