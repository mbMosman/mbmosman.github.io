    <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Martin and I are now doing a Friday anime night and this was one of his picks. We had started to watch it a while ago as a suggestion from Christy, but after a few episodes put it aside. Now we’re picking it up again. It’s not so bad, but that kid sure is loud…</p>

<p>Well, we got through a bit of it, but it’s slow moving in many ways. Martin’s not really into the school thing, and I’m not really into the sports thing. We probably won’t be finishing this one, though I’ll admit to having found it more endearing than I initially expected. However, we’ve moved on to other things for anime night, so I probably will not be finishing this one.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Eijun Sawamura, the pitcher of a novice junior high baseball team, meets with a bitter walk-off loss. For Sawamura the loss becomes his last game in junior high, so he sets a new goal of going to the nationals in high school with his teammates. As he begins his hard quest on studying, a guest arrives unannounced. Her name is Rei Takashima. Rei had been watching his last game and believes Sawamura has a gift. She is the assistant director of the prestigious Seidou High School Baseball Team, and she invites Sawamura to Seido after seeing his potential. Sawamura's reply shocks her, but Takashima refuses to give up and tricks Sawamura into a visit.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>It’s a pretty good opening episode. Sets the stage really well for where things are headed. Introduces Sawmura as a nice guy who’s not very bright, but enjoys having fun with his friends playing baseball. However he seems to be quite a bit more passionate about playing it than they are.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Kazuya Miyuki becomes the catcher for Sawamura in a contest against Seido's dangerous clean-up batter, Kiyokuni Azuma. As Eijun tries to pitch down the middle, he finds himself tense and unable to control the ball. Kazuya immediately calls time and comes out to give him some words of encouragement. The words have the desired effect as Eijun finds more control than ever before and unveils a dangerous weapon he didn't know he had. Seeing how people like Kazuya can alter his pitching, Eijun decides to come to Seido as long as he can become the ace of the team.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Eijun is nervous about rooming with older teammates, but they make him feel a too little at home on his first night. Eijun ends up oversleeping and shows up late when it's time to meet Coach Tesshina Kataoka, a former Japanese pro pitcher. Miyuki also shows up late, but he uses Sawamura as a decoy to sneak into his line. Kataoka shows no mercy and says Eijun can never become a pitcher if he can't show up on time. He also makes Miyuki run laps, as well as Eijun's two room mates for allowing him to oversleep. Sawamura is determined to prove he can be the ace though, so Coach Kataoka gives him a special challenge, saying until he can complete this challenge, he can't play in a baseball game for Seidou.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Seido faces off against Ichidai Third High School, the school that beat them last year. While their top-level offense rakes in runs, the ace Tanba struggles, and the game turns into a batting contest. However Sawamura isn't present. Instead he is training back at school. During his training Furuya, another first-year pitcher, approaches him. Showing sympathy to Sawamura's peculiar training method, Furuya offers to play catch with him. Sawamura is in a cheery mood with Furuya's kindness, but the speed of Furuya's throws far exceeds his expectations.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Looks like we’ve got a rival! Good, I hate it when they have it too easy.</p><p>I have to say that I’m enjoying this more than I expected. Perhaps it’s the anime night sake as much as anime? Hmm…</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Coach Kataoka, or "Shades" as Sawamura calls him, organizes a game between the first years and the non-starters on the second and third year teams. The goal is to determine who will join the starters for upcoming practice games. When Sawamura comes across Kataoka in the bath, the coach gives him one final chance to answer his question. After the answer is given, Sawamura is allowed into the upcoming game, but when he starts as an outfielder, it could spell doom for any chance he has on the varsity team.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>"Thanks to the words of fellow first year Haruichi Kominato, Eijun makes it on base. Next Haruichi promises to bring him home and get the first years a run. Haruichi proves to be a brilliant batter, and thanks to his spring Eijun scores. However the first years quickly get three outs, and Coach Kataoka says he will call it a game unless all the first years agree to continue. Most want to drop out, but thanks to words of encouragement from Eijun they decide to continue. Eijun is placed on the mound, and Hariuchi is placed at shortstop. The two seem to be working effectively together against the older students until Eijun's upperclassman roommate Masuko comes to the plate. Can Eijun find a way to strike out his roommate, who is the #5 hitter for the JV team?"</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>This was a really good episode as it shows that there’s more to Eijun than just a lot of yelling and some wild pitching. He’s got the spirit to pull the team together and out of a slump. We saw that spirit at the start with his middle school friends, but it’s nice to see that he hasn’t lost that sense of team importance now that he’s on a mission to become the HS Ace.</p></p>
