    <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Supernatural dectective work takes center stage with some very interesting characters. It quickly sucked me in with the characters odd-ball nature and the gang of misfits theme. I’m jumping into this a little late, as they are into their 3rd season, but I can see why it would be popular.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize this at first, but many of the characters and their powers are named after literary figures and their works. That’s pretty sweet!</p>

<p>I got about 20 episodes in the first time through, then got distracted by other things, now Martin and I are watching this for our anime night. He seems to like it so far. Woot!</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Nakajima Atsushi, a starving, homeless orphan, sees a man drowning in the river and dives in to rescues the man, intending to rob him. However, the man regains consciousness and introduces himself Osamu Dazi. (He's apparently trying different methods of suicide, but never seems to end up dead.) Seeing that the boy is starving, he and his collegue, Doppo Kunikida, they treat Atsushi to a meal. Atsushi discovers that they work for the Armed Detective Agency, and are searching for a tiger that has been ravaging the area. Atsushi tells them that the tiger has been following him. It was the reason he was kicked out of the orphanage. Dazai persuades him to act as bait to help them capture the tiger, but it turns out that Atsushi is actually the tiger. While they are staked out, he transforms in the moonlight and attacks. Dazai stops him with his special ability, "No Longer Human", which cancels any other ability when he touches that person. The episode ends as the others show up and Dazai offers to make Atsushi a member of the Agency.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Great first episode. It sucks you right in as it introduces the main characters and pulls you into the story. Some of the characters can be a little annoying at first, particularly the suicidal Dazai, but the idea of it wins out. I wanna see where this story is gonna go.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Atsushi decides to look for a job and Dazai offers to help him when they bump Kunikida who tells them about an emergency situation where man has taken a hostage and is threatening to blow up the building. Atsushi is dressed up as a paper boy to distract the bomber, giving Dazai enough time to subdue him. However, the man still presses the detonator and the bomb starts counting down. Seeing no other way to save the others, Atsushi throws himself over the bomb. Howver the bomb doesn't go off. It was all a test to see if Atsushi had the right character to become a member of the Agency. The President leaves the decision to Dazai, and so Atsushi formally becomes a member of the Armed Detective Agency.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Another great episode. Atsushi definities won me over with his save the others routine, but at the same time you feel for him so much! While yes, he wanted to save the others, it also shows just how little he values himself. That side of it is quite sad, though it seems Dazai is little better. It’ll be interesting to get more of his story and see where this relationship between the two of them goes.</p><p>Near the beginning, it seemed like I was able to recognize bits from a lot of the conversation in Japanese, so I thought I’d try to use this as a mini Japanese lesson. I took some extra effort through the intro to try and write out what I thought they were saying, character by character and then try translating that back in Google Translate. Wow, was that ever hard!!! Turns out that while I can generally recognize sayings, I’m terrible at actually hearing the characters correctly. The short intro took me about 30 minutes and I gave up before the end. &gt;.&lt;</p><p>Anyhow, I think it’s actually a good idea, and maybe I can work up to it a bit more. I’ve been getting out of the habit of studying as I get pulled into more and more things at work and home, and I certainly don’t want to start forgetting things!</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>A lady requests help from the agency to deal with some some suspicious characters, assumed to be smugglers. Atsushi and two others, Juichiro & Naomi. Before they go Kunikida warns Atsushi about the area's big bad guy - Akutagawa, a member of Port Mafia. Once they arrive on the scene, the woman reveals herself as, Higuchi Ichuyou, a member of Port Mafia and attacks them. Naomi is injured as she tries to protect her brother, Junichirō, who retaliates with his ablilty "Light Snow". However Akutagawa appears and defeats him. Atsushi isn't harmed, as it was all a trap to capture Atsushi, the weretiger. Atsushi transforms and they fight until Dazai shows up and cancels both powers with "No Longer Human". While Atsushi is out, Akutagawa reveals that Dazai used to be a member of Port Mafia.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Yet another great episode. It wasn’t too surprising to discover that Dazai was once part of the Port Mafia, as they had earlier been trying to guess his previous profession because no one knew. That made me think that it is was likely disreputable, my guess being former gangster. Well, guess it doesn’t need to be unpredictable…</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>After the battle with Akutagawa, Atsushi wakes up on the Agency's clinic. Kunikida warns Atsushi that there's a big bounty on him and that the Port Mafia attack the Agency to capture him. He suggests that Atshushi think what he can do before things go bad. Atsushi takes that to mean he should turn himself in to save the Agency. The Port Mafia's Black Lizard Squad (Tachihara, Hirotsu, and Gin) attack while Atsushi is on his way to surrender, meaning they were going to do it anyway. However he hears the attack and returns to the Agency just in time to see the Agency folks have everything under control.  When he realizes they weren't in any danger and that his surrender isn't what Kunikida was suggesting, he gets all teary. It looks like he's found a home. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Again, it really makes you feel for Atsushi that he’s so used to people not caring about him that he can’t imagine anything else. I almost got teary myself at the end when he realized that they didn’t mean he should leave. The bad guys seem <strong><em>bad</em></strong> but yet the agency defeats them so easily… Why not send the big bad Akutagawa? What are the other Agency members powers?  Inquiring minds want to know!</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>In this episode we meet another member of the Agency, Ranpo, whose special ability, "Super Deduction", allows him to instantly solve a case. They go to the scene of a murder to find the local police there, where the victim is revolves a policewoman. Ranpo challenges one of the officers to solve the murder in 60 seconds, and then when the time is up, he makes the big reveal that the officer himself was the murderer. Dazai shows up on the scene too, and walking back explains to Atsushi that Ranpo doesn't really have a *power*, he solves cases with pure deduction and reasoning. Atsushi asks how that's possible, and Dazai explains that he sorted out some of the facts too, but that even he is impressed with Ranpo's ability.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Cool to see another member of the Agency and their <em>powers</em> or abilities, even if it isn’t supernatural. It’s interesting that Ranpo wants to believe he has a supernatural ability when really he’s just smart. Maybe that doesn’t seem as cool? Excited to learn more about this group of misfits.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>This starts out with Kunikida, Dazai and Atsushi looking into a case of missing tourists. An informant, Rokuzou who Kunikida seems to be looking out for following his father's death, tips them off to an abandoned hospital and they take a cab, driven by another informat out there to check it out. One of the victims, a lady in nothing but her underwear, is found almost drowning in a water tank. Kunikida is able to save her, but they don't make it to the other prisoners in time and they who are gassed. This makes the Agency and specifically Kunikida look bad. Turns out that the taxi driver was responsible for the kidnappings, but wasn't in it alone. He asks for protection in exchange for being a witness, as one of the victims was a member of the Port Mafia. The tip offs are coming from someone called the Azure Messenger, and apparently he's related to events of the Azure King - a bombinf from the past which killed Rokuzou's father. The story line continues into the next episode. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Mystery here… This episode feels a little deeper as it leaves you wondering about Kunikida’s past and his sense of responsibility for Rokuzou and the earlier events. Sometimes the characters come across as pretty juvenile and incapable, so this kinda gives him a bit more depth. This is the first incident that hasn’t really been wrapped up in a single episode, so that also gives things a bit more gravity.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>This continues the Azure Messenger story from the previous episode. In this episode, Kunikida, Dazai, and Atsushi are trying to track down a bomb that is going to kill many people at the end of the day. Dazai seems to be flirting with their rescued victim instead of working, which makes Kunikida angry, but perhaps it is all a ploy. Ranpo returns to help them pin-point the bomb location, but the bomb cannot be disarmed in time, meaning they need to find those responsible and get a remote signal sent to shut it down. Kunikida's kid informant Rakuzou tracks supplies to a military base, where it also happens that the taxi driver was found dead. They spread over and a battle ensues with a boy whose ability allows him to control people marked with numbers until the number counts down to 00 which causes them to die. Dazai & Kunikida defeat the enemies their, and the bomb is disabled. We also get to see Kunikida and Dazai working as a well choreographed pair. In the end, the rescued victim turns out to be the one they are after, acting to revenge her former boyfriend, the Azure King.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Mystery solved, though it seems that Rakuzou was also killed at the end. It was cool to see Kunikida and Dazai in action. Atsushi has been questioning their partnership, but they seem to be well in-tune to each other. At the end however, Dazai is questioning Kunikida’s devotion to his ideals, seeming to imply that they will destroy him similar to how the Azure King was taken out in pursuit of his own ideals.</p></p>

Yosano heads to the front of the train where she encounters the bomber, Kaiji Motojirou. While Atsushi heads to the back where he meets the young assassin Izumi Kyouka and is nearly defeated by her ability "Demon Snow". His ability saves him, but it turns out Kyouka is wearing the bomb. She tries to jump off the train to prevent killing anyone else, and Atsushi jumps after her, using his power to rip off the vest and save her. Yosano also defeats Kaiji, but as the episode ends we see that Dazi is Akutakawa's prisoner. </p>

          <p>Kunikida and Atsushi try to get Kyouka to talk, but she wants boiled tofu first, so Atsushi agrees and he ends up buying. After, Kunikida reminds him that she's many people and is currently being wanted by the government. Instead of turning her in however, Atsushi takes her on a date all around the city, but the last place she asks to go is the police station to turn herself in. Before that can happen though, the Port Mafia and Akutagawa arrive and capture them both. The Agency hears that Atsushi was captured and starts a hunt for him. Meanwhile, Dazai is still a prisioner of the Port Mafia and has been taunting Akutagawa. At the end, another character Chuuya shows up. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Again, Atsushi is trying to save others at his own expense. Kunikida tells him there’s only room for one on his boat, and if he tries to save another, they’ll both end up drowning. However Atsushi isn’t swayed, after all Dazai saved him.</p><p>We aslo learn a bit more about Dazai, who was apparently a pretty important figure before turning traitor and joining the Agency. He used to be Akutagawa’s boss, and taunts him by saying that Atsushi is a better subordinate. It’ll be interesting to see who Chuuya is what Dazai is up to.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>We learn that Chuuya was formerly Dazai's partner and discover that Dazai had setup his capture with some security that means Chuuya can't kill him. He tells Dazai where to find the information he wants and in exchange Dazai won't make is seem like Chuuya facilitated his escape. Atsushi and Akutagawa battle it out, and Atsushi's strength is starting to show. He does more than just fend off Akutagawa, and defeats him in the end but is badly wounded and unconcious. Kyouka drags him to saftey where Kunikia is waiting to take them back. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Dazai and Chuuya turn out to have been partners. Dazai has setup his capture to learn about where Atsushi’s bounty came from. Cool to see that he does seem to care about this stray he’s picked up. It seems another group of ability users, the Guild is about to enter the stage. Things are getting interesting…</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>In the aftermath of Atsushi and Dazai's abduction, the Agency must decide what to do with Kyouka, the loose end. Meanwhile the Port Mafia also deliberates what to do with Akutagawa, now comatose as his enemies seek Vengence.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Kyouka saving Atsushi at her own expense makes her seem much more genuine. Interesting to see another with the same or similar powers. I guess they are not all unique… It was also great to see that Higuchi is loyal to Akutagawa, even though he seems to have little <em>need</em> of her. Also nice to see that when she gets into trouble, the rest of the gang was there to rescue her when she thought she was all alone and it was all over.</p></p>
