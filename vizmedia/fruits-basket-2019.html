    <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Yay! Fruits Basket lives again! I’m excited for this new version of the anime as it is meant to follow the full story from the manga (which the earlier Fruits Basket anime production did not). Woot! I can’t wait to meet <strong><em>all</em></strong> the characters this time!</p>

<p>Christy and I kicked off our Spring 2019 anime watching with the first two episodes and while I wasn’t as keen on the new skinny art look, the story was familiar and as endearing as ever. It’s cool that this seems to stick a little closer to the manga story and go a little deeper perhaps into the storylines of Tohru &amp; our Sohma zodiac. There are already some little sneak peeks at what is to come - for example a little baseball cap is popping up here and there, which has significance we’ll learn about later on. Seeing this again makes me <strong><em>so</em></strong> happy!!!</p>

<p>Alas, the first season is over. Sigh… But this time I know the story will continue! It was so awesome to finally see the fuller manga story filled out in anime. I should have expected the first season to end in the same place as that original anime, but for whatever reason I didn’t. This version however didn’t feel nearly as rushed and awkwardly squished in the end as the earlier version. It’s a great pause point, ready for a new beginning.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>At the beginning, we are introduced to Tohru Honda, who is a high school girl living in a tent in the woods after her mother's death. On her way to school, she sees a house and out of curiousity peeks at zodiac figurines sitting outside. Her classmate Yuki Sohma lives there with his cousin Shigure, the house's owner. Yuki and Tohru walk to school together, causing Tohru to be harassed by some of Yuki's admirers. She is saved by her friends Arisa Uotani and Saki Nakajima. Later that night, Yuki and Shigure are walking home and see Tohru returning to the tent. After hearing her story, they offer to let her stay temporarily with them in exchange for housework. As she and Yuki are taking her stuff upstair, Kyo (another of Yuki's cousins) crashes through the roof and challenge him to a fight. Tohru trys to stop him, and ends up accidentally embracing Kyo, causing him to turn into a cat. Panic ensues, and then she falls into Yuki and Shigure, who slso turn into a rat and a dog respectively as the episode ends.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>It’s so awesome to be watching this again! I’m so excited to see the full story animated!!!</p><p>I also just starting to re-read the manga from the recently published collectors edition, and it’s nice that this time around the anime is sticking much closer to the story from the manga. The biggest difference so far is a little baseball cap that keeps popping up along with a memory Tohru has of a little boy putting it on her head. We’ll learn more about this cap as the story continues, and it ends up having a lot of significance, but I didn’t recall it at all from the previous anime series. This seems to imply that this one will go a little deeper, sicking closer to the original story. I’m looking forward to that, but it’ll be interesting to see if all the Fruits Basket fans appreciate that or not.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The episode starts with Shigure explaining that he, Yuki and Kyo, and others in the Soma family are possessed by the spirits of the Chinese zodiac, causing them to transform whenever they feel weak, stressed or are embraced by someone of the opposite sex. Although Tohru promises to keep the Somas' family secret, Yuki is concerned that the family head, Akito, will have her memory will be erased to protect their secret. Shigure also says that Kyo will be living with them. He tricked Kyo into taking the transfer exam for their high school, so they'll also all be in school together. At school the next day, Yuki tells Tohru her memory might be erased. She says it is ok's, but asks him to make friends with her again. Kyo jumps out the 2nd floor window to escape all the attention from his classmates, and Yuki finds him hiding out and another fight nearly breaks out, but Tohru stops them, again accidentally turning Kyo into a cat. He yells, at her and she leaves. Later, he walks her home and tries to appologize.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>For the school cultural festival, they're going to have a rice ball stand. Kyo is mad that the class rejected his idea and latched onto Yuki's instead. He tells Tohru that he envies Yuki not just for being part of the zodiac, but for being smart and respected by others. After class, Kyo is baited into playing cards (Rich Man - Poor Man) by Uo, and Yuki sees them having fun and later tells Tohuru he is envious of Kyo's ability to interact and get along so easily with everyone. The next morning as Tohru is making rice balls for the school festival, she tries to use the plum on the back of the rice ball as an analogy for why people see the good qualities of others, but can't see the good qualities in themselves - like the plum on a rice ball it's on their back. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>This is one of my favorite bits of this story as it is just so perfect. That Kyo and Yuki are constantly fighting while both being envious of the other is so relatable, and the rice ball analogy, while completely cheesey is also just so perfect for the story. Then of course there’s Kyo, telling Tohru that he can see the plum on her back, but it’s just a teeny-tiny little one… It’s definitely a top anime moment.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>In this episode, we meet Kagura Sohma who shows up at the house looking for Kyo. At first she seems quiet and shy, but then all her emotions burst out as she pummels him. She says that she's Kyo's fiancee, but Kyo doesn't go along saying that was under threatening cirumstances when they were kids. To prove her love Kagura insists on cooking dinner, but her feast is ruined when Kyo refuses to join and Kagura loses her temper, ruining more of Sigure's house. Kagura goes the the store to get more food, leaving her purse/money behind, but Tohru follows and buys the groceries. They talk on the way back and cook hamburgers together. While Kagura still sees her as a rival, they become friends. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Kagura isn’t my favorite character. In many ways she’s like Hatsuharu (who we haven’t met yet in the anime), but for some reason, I can tolerate him, but not her. Maybe that’s a cultural thing - we can tolerate temper in men but not women? I don’t know, maybe it isn’t the temper and violence, maybe it’s the obsessive, clingy <em>love</em>. She’s definitely an extreme character, but maybe bits of that hit too close to home or something.</p><p>Anyhow, I suppose because of that, this isn’t one of my favorite episodes. However there are some interesting bits to it. She mentions something of Kyo’s <em>true form</em>, which he quickly cuts off. That plants some seeds for later. It’s also sweet how Tohru tells Kagura that she wants to be more like her, to see all the good things about people she likes. You can see that Kagura has never had someone say anything like that to her. It’s quite touching.</p><p>While the storyline of this episode generally mirrors the earlier anime, they differ quite a bit in the details. This new version sticks a lot closer to the manga original. I do however miss the little scene with the cat and mouse shaped patches to the paper screens.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Tohru announces that the renovations at her grandfather's house have been completed, and would be moving back in the next day. Her decision leaves the Sohmas seemingly in agreement that her stay with them was only a temporary circumstance. The next day, Tohru arrives back at her grandfather's place and is greeted by her relatives whom he was staying with. Later Tohru's aunt reveals that she had known about Tohru's living arrangement with the Sohmas thanks to a private detective and is concerned that this (including Kyoko's violent past) would negatively affect her son's ambitions to become a police officer. The discussion comes to a head when Tohru's grandfather slaps the son following his jeers at her, and the grandfather allows Tohru to live freely (as her parents had done) if she wants. Tohru breaks down as she truthfully reveals that she wants to spend more time with the Sohmas. Yuki and Kyo, who were both listening in from the outside after being bothered by Tohru's leaving, arrive to take Tohru back to their home. Yuki tells off the aunt's son for his meanness to Tohru, while Kyo tells Tohru that it is alright to be selfish once in a while, causing Tohru to remember her mother giving her the exact same advice when she was young. Thus Tohru joyfully moves back in with the Sohmas.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>This is another of my favorite episodes as Tohru finds the home she’s always wanted. Having just recently read through this in the manga, this again is sticking much closer to the details from the original writing. While I do think that’s pretty cool, I also miss some of the freedom they had to re-imagine the details in the original anime. Afterall not <em>all</em> the details are important, but maybe then that’s just the me who is realizing it will take another season or so to get to the parts of the story we didn’t see initially…</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The rice ball stand at the school festival is a success, mainly due to Yuki reluctantly cross-dressing at the third year girls' insistence. Momiji and Hatori Sohma also visit the stand. Momiji causes chaos when he hugs Tohru and transforms into a rabbit, but Yuki serves as a distraction to save the day. Yuki warns Tohru to not be alone with Hatori, as he is the doctor who wipes people's memories. After the festival ends, Tohru's best friends Uo and Hana confront her about her close relationship with Yuki, and Tohru inadvertently reveals that she is living with them. To decide if they are OK with this, they invite themselves to a sleepover. When they lament that they weren't there to help Tohru, Yuki and Kyo remind them that Tohru is the type of person who would ask for help. As they are heading to bed, we learn the significance of the baseball cap that keeps popping up. Tohru tells Uo and Hana how she was saved and guided home by a young boy, after being chased by bullies and getting lost. The episode ends as Tohru gets a phone call from Hatori, asking her to come by and see him alone.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>While Momiji comes across as quite annoying at first, he’s the sunshine of the Sohmas and one of my favorite among them.</p><p>I love the friendship that Tohru, Uo and Hana share. Their bond really comes through in this episode in a way that is believable despite being pretty sugar coated. It also shows that Yuki and Kyo are really getting to know the <em>real</em> Tohru, even though they haven’t been together very long.</p></p>

When Hatori leaves the room, Momiji shares that Hatori had to wipe the memory of his relationship with a woman, Kana Sohma. Tohru also discovers Hatori's zodiac animal is the Dragon when she slips and Hatori catches he, turning him into a seahorse. While transformed, Hatori flashes back to when he first met Kana two years previously. The pair were soon in a relationship and Kana found out Hatori's secret. They asked to be married, but Akito went into a violent rage that caused Hatori to nearly go blind in his left eye. Akito yells at Kana that it was her fault, and Kana blamed herself, becoming severly depressed. To end it, Hatori to wiped her memories of their relationship at Akito's suggestion. Hatori wakes up and soon hears Kana chatting with her friends that she is engaged to someone else. He is happy to she that has moved on and is happy. When Hatori asks Tohru what happens to snow when melted, Tohru simply replies "Spring comes", the same answer Kana gave. Hatori later leaves Tohru with Shigure. After she catches a glimpse of Akito, Tohru asks Shigure about the curse, but for now he declines to answer.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Again, while this sticks much closer to the original manga, I feel that I liked the original version of this story a bit better… Perhaps it’s just nostalgia talking though.</p></p>
