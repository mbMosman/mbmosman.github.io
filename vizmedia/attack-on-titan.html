    <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I was just about to dive into the new season when Martin and I picked up anime night again and I decided to try this out on him. Seems like it is going well so far. Woot!</p>

<p>I must say that when I first started watching this, I did not expect to like it. It was all hyped, and I figured I’d watch to see what it was all about. The titans start eating people, and ish!!! I was close to tossing it after the first episode, but then remembered my friend Grant’s 3 episode rule. By the 3rd episode I was hooked and had to see where this was going. Fortunately the titans aren’t <em>always</em> there eating people. There’s room here for some depth, so I’m curious to see whether or not the show delivers on any of that.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>For over a century, humans have been living in settlements surrounded by three 50m gigantic walls, Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, which prevent the Titans, giant humanoid creatures who eat humans, from entering. Eren Jaeger, of the town called the Shiganshina District, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join, which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger, who promises to show him what lies in their basement once he returns. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlelt from a group of delinquents due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever, the Colossal Titan, a 60m Titan suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush back to their house, only to see Carla pinned under their collapsed house. As a Smiling Titan approaches them, Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and assures them that he will defend them. However, as he charges towards the Titan, he is overcome with fear and takes Eren and Mikasa away. Eren watches in horror as a Smiling Titan eats Carla.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>I think this is a rather gripping first episode as Eren witnesses the death of his mother, who is eatten by one of the invading titans. It certainly puts conviction behind his passion for fighting back against them.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Hannes apologizes to Eren for not saving his mother, admitting he was afraid of the Smiling Titan and that both Eren and Mikasa are still weak children. Some of townsfolk of the Shiganshina District escape to the inner Wall Maria, while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but the Armored Titan rams the gate, breaching the inner Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace, choose to fight, only to be wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The drill instructor Keith Sadies inspects the new recruits of the 104th Cadet Corps and provides a barrage of verbal insults. When he comes across Sasha Braus, who is eating a potato, he punishes her by having her run around the camp until sunset and not giving her any food or drink. Eren develops a rivalry with Jean Kirschtein, who desires a safe and easy position in the Military Police Regiment within the inner city walls. The recruits train on an omni-directional mobility gear[10] apparatus, where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables. After Eren has trouble balancing, he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans. The next day, Eren balances on the apparatus but falls, but Keith discovers that Eren's apparatus was defective and passes him after a retry with different equipment.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>So watching this now a 2nd time is interesting as I’m paying more attention to some of these other characters in the training squad than I had the first time around. I don’t want to give any spoilers for what is to come, but it’s a really good repeat watch too!</p></p>

After training in hand-to-hand combat with Reiner and Annie Leonhart, Eren learns later that night that Jean and several other recruits hope to join the Military Police Regiment to avoid having to fight Titans. On graduation day, Eren and Mikasa rank among the top ten of their class. They are eligible to join the Military Police Regiment, but Eren declines and announces that he is joining the Scout Regiment on the front lines, leading Armin and Mikasa to join him. They are assigned to the Trost District, one of the cities which is at the outer edge of Wall Rose, where they discover other classmates have joined. The Colossal Titan appears and breaches the gate. Once Eren regains his composure, he takes command and orders a counterattack.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The Colossal Titan destroys the wall's cannons, but it vanishes into a burst of steam before Eren prepares to attack its weak point. The Military Police Regiment scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses before the Titans enter the city. Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison Regiment to different squads, Mikasa helps with the evacuation, while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. As Eren and Armin's squad attack, their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one, with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fates, is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed. Eren, recalling when he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls, manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan's mouth at the last moment. He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan's mouth, but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's arm and swallowing him.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Oh nos! Eren get’s swallowed up! But how sweet saving his friend… Is it bad that not for a moment do I really believe Eren will be dead? (Even the first time, I didn’t buy it!)</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Armin awakens to find Eren missing and blames himself not being strong enough to save him. Meanwhile, the exit gate is blocked by a merchant cart while a crowd of refugees is trying to escape. An abberant Titan appears and starts charging the gate, but the crowd is saved by Mikasa, who kills the Titan, and then threatens the greedy merchant until he allows the refugees to pass first. We then flashback to earlier in Mikasa's childhood when, Mikasa was kidnapped by three slave traders, who murdered her parents in a struggle. Eren & his father discovered the bodies, and disobeying his father, Eren went off on his own and tracked down the kidnappers. He and Mikasa killing them and escape. Eren's courage allowed Mikasa to overcame her fear own fear and and gain the resolve to fight back. With her parents dead, Mikasa goes to live with Eren and his parents. Back in the present, the battle continues, with Mikasa slaying more Titans before going back to help the other squads evacuate.</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>I feel for Armin, who’s just not as <em>tough</em> as his friends and seems to always be getting rescued. It’s hard to feel like you’re always depending on someone else. I really like Mikasa’s character for being quite the badass, but at the same time I kinda feel bad for her too. She seems to have a shell around her, and others clearly see her as a cold person. She clearly cares deeply for her friends though, so she’s not as heartless as she comes off.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The surviving squads are low on gas for their mobility gear and unable to reach the inner walls. Seeing the supply depot is overrun by Titans, they lose their will to fight. Mikasa joins them and learns that Armin's entire squad has perished, including Eren. Seemingly undaunted, she rallies the others to reclaim the supply depot, but Mikasa ends up running out of gas midair and falls into an alleyway. Jean assumes command, but he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans. As a Titan approaches, Mikasa prepares to attack with her remaining broken blade knowing she won't survive. However, a mysterious dark haired Titan appears behind her, and saves her by brutally killing the Titan. Armin and Conny show up, shocked to witness the mysterious Titan not only fighting other Titans, but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand-to-hand combat techniques, while completely ignoring the humans. Armin gives Mikasa his gas tanks and blades so that she can support the others at the supply depot. Mikasa, however, refuses to leave him behind to die. </p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>This is cool both because it shows that Mikasa isn’t as cold hearted as she appears, and because it shows Armin is clever enough to realize this and jump in to help his friend. They really do a great job of showing the friendship between this trio of Armin, Mikasa, and Eren.</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The supply depot is surrounded by Titans, but Armin plots to use the mysterious dark-haired Titan to defeat them. They fight off the Titan's attacking him, and lure him to the depot. Armin's plan works, so while the mystery Titan attract the enemies outside, the group sneaks in to the depot to resupply. Inside, they must fight a group of smaller Titans to get to fuel storage. Armin devises another plan to draw the Titans' attention to an elevator, then shoot them in the eyes to blind them, while their best seven attack from the ceiling behind to finish them off. Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets, but are saved by Mikasa and Annie. Successful, they refuel and prepare to retreat. Leaving, they see the mystery Titan collapse, and are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body. Mikasa reaches Eren and cries upon confirming that he is alive. Armin is surprised to see that Eren's severed leg and arm have been regenerated...</p>
          
          
          
          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p><p>Woot! Armin gets his moment in the spotlight and proves his worth to the team! Awesome! And well, of course we all knew Eren couldn’t <em>really</em> be dead. (This isn’t Game of Thrones…)</p></p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Captain Levi of the Scout Regiment and his squad successfully retake a town from the Titans until they are called to an emergency at the Trost District as the Titans have invaded the city. When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan, he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims. His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan's stomach by transforming himself into the mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them. Although Eren's comrades saw him emerge from the mysterious Titan, they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose. However, Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren. Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren, but to no avail. As Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them, Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key. In order to protect Mikasa and Armin from the cannons, Eren partially transforms himself into a Titan, sheltering them inside his ribs.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Eren climbs out of the partially transformed Titan, telling Mikasa and Armin about the basement in his former house. He believes that it holds the secret to mankind's preservation and the key to destroying the Titans. Kitts once again orders the cannon to be loaded out of fear. Eren comes up with two plans of escape. The first is for Eren to retreat as a Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity, and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger. Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite his cowardice, deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed. Armin tentatively convinces Kitts, only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in. Eren agrees, regardless of whether or not he will be able to control himself as a Titan.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>As Armin helps Pyxis's subordinates coordinate a plan, morale among the troops begin to drop, as some want to desert and be with their families. Pyxis silences everyone by reminding them that if they abandon this chance to finally win against the Titans, they will be subjecting their families to their terror, which convinces the troops to stay. Claiming that Eren is the result of a secret project to turn humans into Titans, Pyxis plans to have most of the troops gather at a far corner of the Trost District to lure most of the Titans away while Eren as a Titan carries the giant boulder to seal the hole. Along with Mikasa, Eren will be guarded during the mission by three of the best elites of the Garrison, them being Ian Dietrich, Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach. As they approach the giant boulder, Rico, who is doubtful of the mission's success and does not completely trust Eren, reminds him that many lives are at stake. Finally reaching the boulder, Eren transforms himself into a Titan, only to suddenly attack Mikasa.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Mikasa tries to reason with Eren in as he is a Titan, but to no avail. Eren continues his attack and accidentally incapacitates himself, slumping to the ground. The squad protecting Eren sends up a red flare to signal that the plan has failed, much to the dismay of the troops observing from the wall. As Armin heads toward Eren to investigate, the elite squadron argues and eventually agrees to protect Eren instead of abandoning him, still recognizing him as a valuable military asset. During the operation, Jean is separated from Connie and Annie after his omni-directional mobility gear malfunctions, forcing him to hide from two Titans in a building. Armin reaches the unconscious Eren, but Mikasa calls to him, warning that he is in a dangerous state. Armin plunges his sword into the side of Eren's neck, which briefly awakens him. As Armin speaks to him of the outside world and reminds him of his promise to kill all the Titans, Eren leaves his dreamlike state and regains control.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Jean manages to acquire another set of omni-directional mobility gear from a dead soldier and escapes, thanks to Annie, Connie and Marco Bott distracting the Titans. With Eren as a Titan carrying the boulder towards the gate, Ian orders everyone to protect Eren from the Titans at all costs. Eren finally blocks the open gate with the boulder, and Rico fires a yellow flare to signal that the operation was a success. As Armin tries to pull Eren from his Titan body, they are cornered by two Titans, but Levi saves them in the nick of time. All Titans remaining in the Trost Districts are eliminated except two, which are captured for research. Jean, Sasha and Annie all mourn the deaths of their fellow comrades among several casualties. Meanwhile, Eren is chained in a cell guarded by the Military Police Regiment, where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin Smith of the Scout Regiment. After listening to his story and reasons for wanting the Titans dead, Levi allows Eren to join his squad under his command, though Eren is warned that Levi would personally kill him if he ever betrays the squad or loses control again.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>The populace is divided over whether Eren is their savior or their end. Eren is brought to a military tribunal to be judged by Commander-in-Chief Dhalis Zachary, who will decide whether Eren should be given to the Military Police Regiment or the Scout Regiment, both of whom have their own reasons for wanting him. The Military Police Regiment wants Eren killed as he is seen by them as a menace, while the Scout Regiment wants to use him to retake Wall Maria. Becoming furious upon hearing from a merchant that Mikasa is accused of being a Titan as well, Eren calls out the Military Police Regiment and their supporters for their cowardice. Levi brutally beats down Eren in retaliation, but Eren does not transform into a Titan. Levi uses this to show to the court that the Scout Regiment can control Eren, and proposes that Eren is to be made part of his squad. In the end, Zachary gives Eren to the Scout Regiment, where Erwin and Hange Zoë welcome him. As Eren is getting treatment for his wounds, they discover that he grew back a tooth knocked out after being beaten down by Levi.</p>

          <p>Levi and his Special Operations Squad, composed of Eld Gin, Oruo Bozad, Petra Rall and Günther Schultz, bring Eren to the old Scout Regiment headquarters, where Eren will learn to control his Titan powers under their watch. As Levi orders the castle to be cleaned, Petra assures Eren that Levi does care about the people under his command despite his rude and harsh demeanor. Meanwhile, Erwin and Miche Zacharius discuss the new recruits joining the Scout Regiment and how they must prove Eren's usefulness to Military Command within a month. Hange asks Eren to help her in her experiments with the two Titans they have captured, which she named Sawney and Beane. She has an obsession with Titans where she treats them like people despite the many times she puts herself in danger. It is revealed that the Titans need sunlight to survive and their bodies are disproportionately light despite their size. The next day, the Scout Regiment discover that Sawney and Beane have been killed. As Hange mourns for them, the Scout Regiment deduce that the culprit is a soldier who escaped using their omni-directional mobility gear, which makes them wonder who their true enemy is.</p>

          <p>As the recruits are investigated over Sawney and Beane's deaths, Annie, who will be joining the Military Police Regiment later, gives advice to Armin and Conny that it is their choice to decide on which military division they should join. The 104th Cadets are later greeted by Erwin at the Decision Ceremony, where he tells them that the goal of the Scout Regiment's expedition on the following month is to reclaim the Shiganshina District and find the secret hidden in the basement of Eren's home. After telling the recruits of the Scout Regiment's high mortality rate during each expedition, Erwin tells the recruits that they may stay and join them or leave to join the other branches. Most recruits leave, but Jean joins the Scout Regiment in honor of Marco with others joining him as well including Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Bertholdt, Conny, Sasha, Christa and Ymir, despite their fears. As the Scout Regiment prepare themselves for the expedition, Eren is reunited with his friends and learns what happened to the others. Jean questions whether Eren can truly control his Titan powers as they are risking their lives for him. With everything ready, the Scout Regiment begin their 57th Expedition beyond the walls.</p>

          <p>As the 57th Expedition gets underway, the Scout Regiment assemble into their Long-Range Scouting Formation, wherein the Scouts spread out around the main wagon train and report by flare gun if Titans are nearby so the group can alter course to avoid conflict with them if possible. After Armin's squad manages to kill an Abnormal Titan, a Female Titan suddenly appears from the right flank at high speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body withstands their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin, but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean, who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans. Armin then realizes that the Female Titan is possibly another intelligent Titan like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting locations for where Eren is in the formation, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and that they must stop her. Avoiding their failed attempts to attack, she leaves them and heads towards the center group.</p>

Meanwhile, news reaches the center group about the annihilation of their right flank by the Female Titan as she continues to wreak havoc within the formation. The whole formation soon reaches the Forest of Giant Trees with only the center row entering, while the rest defend the forest from Titans. Eren realizes something is wrong when his squad has no idea what Erwin's orders are and what Levi is doing. As the Female Titan chases at their heels, the squad desperately await Levi's command to attack, but Levi instead tells his squad to cover their ears as he fires his flare gun.</p>

          <p>Levi fires a noise round and tells the squad to keep moving forward. With more of the rearguard being killed by the Female Titan, Eren begs his squad to let him fight, but they tell him to trust Levi's decision. Eren recalls when he was unable to transform into a Titan for experimental purposes in front of Hange, Levi and his squad. During a break when he tried to pick up a teaspoon, Eren suddenly partially transformed, leading Hange to deduce that Eren is able to transform into a Titan not by solely injuring himself but also due to his desire to fulfill his goals. The squad apologized to Eren and told him they should trust each other. Remembering this, Eren decides to trust his squad's plan. It is then revealed that Levi's squad is bait to lure the Female Titan into an ambush, where Erwin and his men fire hundreds of grappling hooks to trap the Female Titan. Levi leaves his squad to meet up with Erwin to determine the identity of the Female Titan.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>With the Female Titan restrained, Erwin and Levi try to ascertain her identity with no success as she is able to crystallize her skin to prevent them from cutting out the human inside. Armin, Jean and the rest of Levi's squad realize it was Erwin's plan to use Eren as bait to draw out the mole within the army who joined them after the Walls fell and only revealed his plan to those who were part of the Scout Regiment before the fall. Meanwhile, the others wonder what is happening inside the forest. Levi taunts the Female Titan, prompting her to give a loud scream that draws all Titans in the vicinity towards her. Despite the Scout Regiment's attempt to stop them, the Titans ignore the humans and eat the Female Titan's body in a frenzy which makes Erwin call off the expedition. However, with no confirmation that the mole has also been eaten by the Titans, Erwin orders Levi to regroup with his squad. Meanwhile, the mole, disguised as a cloaked Scout Regiment member, attacks Levi's squad and kills Günther.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>Erwin tells Hange that it was a mistake to think all intelligent Titans are like Eren, since the Female Titan has unique abilities far beyond that of a novice. Elsewhere, the mole transforms into the Female Titan and chases after Levi's squad. Armin theorizes that the mole is someone who had seen Eren transform during the invasion of the Trost District. Eren wants to transform into a Titan, but the squad tells him to trust in their skills and keep moving forward. Eld, Oruo and Petra manage to blind the Female Titan and attempt to cut off her arms. However, the Female Titan quickly regenerates her right eye and kills the three. Seeing his comrades dead, a grieving Eren transforms into a Titan. Believing his comrades and squad's death could have been avoided if he had transformed in the first place, Eren fights the Female Titan in a long battle. The Female Titan finally defeats Eren by taking off his head and swallowing his human body. Mikasa attempts to stop the Female Titan, but to no avail. She is later joined by Levi, who tells her to keep their distance, as the Female Titan is getting tired.</p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>While Mikasa distracts the Female Titan in order to get Eren back, Levi debilitates her, but injures his leg while saving Mikasa. They retrieve Eren from the mouth of the Titan, leaving it badly wounded but alive as they make their escape. Meanwhile, the Scout Regiment retrieves most of the corpses of their comrades, but some were irretrievable due to the swarming Titans. Erwin orders them to go, leaving those remaining to be reported missing in action. Two disobey to retrieve a friend, but they return chased by two Titans. One is killed by Mikasa, but the other is gaining on the group. To outrun the other Titan, Levi orders them to dispose the corpses to lighten the wagon's load. Later, Eren wakes up from a dream to find they have returned. The townspeople not only berate the Scout Regiment's ineptitude, but also become enraged and upset at Erwin over the failure of the mission and the casualties that were sustained. As a result of the failed expedition, Erwin and his subordinates are summoned to the capital, where the final decision of Eren's custody will be made.</p>
