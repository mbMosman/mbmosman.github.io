    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>First, I just have to say that damn this book is <strong>LONG!</strong>  I foolishly made an assumption that because of the length, this would be a self contained book, ie not a series. Stupid!!! It totally cliff hangers at the end with a ‘To Be Continued’.</p>

<p>This book is one that you’ll either adore for the length &amp; depth of detail or not. While I can be appreciative of detail that is helpful to get you into the world and spirit of a book, this felt like an onerous chore to read because of it all. Some of it helps you to visualize and feel the world, but quite frankly a lot of it does not. The book really needed a good and judicious editor. This should not be a story that needs 2000 pages across two volumes to wrap up.</p>

<p>All of this detail also includes a lot of history &amp; character introduction. These early stories jump through time and from character to character, seemingly unconnected, though very slowly weaving themselves together. It was a fairly tough read at first. There’s a lot of information packed in and many characters and relationships to sort out without a lot of guidance and only a bit of room for speculation on where things are headed. The main plot is not really clear until the <em>big bad</em> is revealed, 600 pages into the book. Yes, that’s more than half way through this first book.</p>

<p>One our <em>big bad</em> is revealed, there’s enough information to start piecing things together and speculate on where things are headed. At this point things pick up a bit. These aliens are pretty alien, and their comfort with xenocide seems to clearly indicate conflict is imminent. Take the kids out of Ender’s Game and there are some similarities here.</p>

<p>In the end I’m satisfied. The plot is well played out overall, without too much seeming too easy. Sadly though, there’s sadly no conclusion to be had here. The ending is brutally abrupt, and frankly after nearly 1000 pages it’s a pretty shitty place to leave folks hanging. I think I’d feel less hurt by that if it weren’t so goddamn long, but really with some planning, there were many other great opportunities to break this story up into smaller volumes where they might have had some sense of closure from volume to volume. I’m quite irritated that no effort at all was made to do that. It’ll be a bit before I work up the willpower to read another volume, since it is as long and, one must assume, as dense and slow-moving as this one.</p>

<p>I haven’t true scifi like this in quite some time, and that probably warms me up to this book more than it truly deserves. However even with the slow pacing, I still find myself thinking it was one of the better books I’ve read lately,however much it depresses me to say that. While I don’t intent to jump into book two right away, I am resolved to get a bit more scifi back on the reading list.</p>
