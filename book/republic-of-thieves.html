    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>It has been a while since I read the first two books in this series, but I recall having absolutely loved the first book while just being OK with the second. As I was finishing up those first two, this third book was recently out, but I couldn’t yet get a copy at the library. (At the time I think I was too lazy to go in person and was waiting on the ebook.)Recently I was sorting through my <strong>Want to Read</strong> list and bumped into this again. While I’ve forgotten a lot of the details of the earlier books, I recalled a fondness for Locke and Jean, so I moved it back to the top.</p>

<p>My hopes were pretty high for this. I realize that time clouds things. That it is possible I wouldn’t enjoy the earlier books now, as much as I did then, but I was more than a little disappointed in this volume of the story. I suppose it wasn’t exactly <em>bad</em>, but it wasn’t great either. The end here is pretty clearly setup for another volume, but I suspect this will be my last run with Jean &amp; Locke.</p>

<p>I had two main problems with this book. First, I found the constant hopping between the past and present to be jarring. Since we didn’t get many details about Locke and Sabatha’s relationship in the earlier books, we got all those details filled in here. That story wasn’t bad, but going back and forth was rough, and really only relevant to give back story on their relationship. (Honestly though, I enjoyed that historical story more…)</p>

<p>Problem #2, hinges more on the main plot of this volume. There are these bondsmagi, and they have this entertaining election every so many years, and Locke and Sabatha are pitted aginst each other to win. Threats are made against the other to ensure their cooperation. The whole bondsmagi plot felt contrived and strangely out of place to me. Patience, supposedly concieved all of this as a masterwork of revenge, for the not-quite-death of a son who hates her. The whole thing just felt wrong and patched together.</p>

<p>Overall, it was just unsatisfying. For all his earlier cleverness and skill, Locke was played as quite the fool for pretty much the entire book. I suppose it was all for love, or something like that, but the Locke / Sabatha thing borders on obsession for Locke. Also, I find Sabatha’s lingering fondness for him to be just a little unusual and out of character, but perhaps that’s just my view toward someone who’s main pluses are blind love and that he just won’t go away. In the end Patience’s revenge is supposed to taint even this love/obsession, but frankly at that point I hardly care.</p>

<p>The end should have been left with the election outcome and Sabatha’s departure. Had there been more mystery on what might be coming next, I might have been open to giving the series a second chance with another volume. Instead this book ends with what I assume is a peek into the next volume, with more bondsmagi drama. Having mixed feelings already, that pretty much sealed the deal on this being my last foray into the world of the Gentlemen Bastards.</p>
