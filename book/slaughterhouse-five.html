    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>OK, so books about war, particularly actual <em>in our world</em> events, are generally not my thing. I like to escape with my reading and not think about history, consequences, and the longer term fallout of these things. I am not really very historically knowledgeable, certainly not outside of what I had to know to make it through HS history class. Funny how little WW II was covered there. I didn’t realize for example that Dresden was fire bombed.  So there was a bit to process here with this book that I probably should have been more aware of ahead of time.</p>

<p>Putting <em>war sucks</em> aside for a moment, this book was amazing. It took getting past the first chapter or so, and really getting into Billy Pilgrim’s tale for me to truly get into the story. However, I suppose that you really couldn’t just start by diving in there either. While I can harldy fault it for being a little slow at the beginning, I suspect that is why I hadn’t read this before, even though I’m about 90% certain it was on my HS reading list.</p>

<p>Overall, the storytelling is pretty amazing. Clearly there are reasons that it’s won so many awards and has been a long time classic. This sort of war story, time travel, alien kidnapping mixture isn’t something that should work, but it does. It works like magic here. It helped to keep me engaged in a story I otherwise probably wouldn’t have finished, and helped to make it a little less dark without taking away from the depth of the issues.  I feel like this review does this book no justice at all, but lucky for anyone else reading this, there are plenty of other reviews out there.</p>
