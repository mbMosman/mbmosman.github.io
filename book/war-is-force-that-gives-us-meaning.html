    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>Well, this wasn’t exactly light reading, but it’s not as heavy as one might imagine either. The author presents an interesting perspective, but I also didn’t feel like I learned anything that I didn’t already know or perceive. In that sense I felt like the authors actual experience and insights were lost and trivialized in the larger diatribe against the evils of war and nationalism.</p>

<p>It also wasn’t really clear to me what the author wanted the audience to take away from the book. It paints a pretty broad picture of war, both historical and modern, but doesn’t offer answers, give meaning, or really provide much to take away - short of the obvious. I get that war can bring out the worst in people, that the heroics people are praised for afterwards are not the reality, and that much of it is just political story weaving. I guess I was looking for something deeper or more insightful, when perhaps there isn’t depth or insight left to be had.</p>

<p>In all fairness, perhaps at the time this was actually published, it was more insightful and impactful. What I’d really like to know now is how the author would respond to what has come out of the more recent events. A lot has happened in the last 15+ years.</p>
