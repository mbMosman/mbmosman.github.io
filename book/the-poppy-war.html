    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>This was a pick from Goodreads as it was a nominee for the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/21332-goodreads-choice-award">Goodreads Choice Award</a> both for Fantasy and Debut Author in 2018, though it didn’t win either. It lost the fantasy award to Circe by Madeline Miller, which is on my to-read list but has a nice long library wait list. It lost the debut author to Tomi Adeyemi’s Children of Blood and Bone, which seems intriguing if a little dark, also on the to-read, but waiting list. Winning isn’t everything, though. Despite this having me a little worried about it being another take on Hunger Games, this seemed the most interesting to me from the nominee list last year.</p>

<p>We’ll have to see how it turns out…</p>

<p>I finally got around to reading this just as my library loan was wrapping up. I was hoping to get squeeze it, but it just didn’t happen. Time was short, but the truth was the book just wasn’t worth finishing. While I can see why it might be nominated for an award, I can also see why it probably wouldn’t actually win.</p>

<p>I feel that I should be a little more forgiving, as it is a first book for this author, but I just can’t see finishing this up. I made it to about the halfway point, leaving off as Part 2 kickes off. Overall, it felt like this was just shallowly pieced together bits of character and plot from a bunch of other books. They were loosely fitted together to suite this story, but the characters never really came alive for me, and the plot up through this point was pretty thin.</p>

<p>Throughout all of Part 1, it is really just Runin (our main heroine) ridiculously pushing her own limits to get into school and make it through the first year. I didn’t really feel anything for her as a character at all. She wasn’t likable or unlikable or even really memorable at all. I don’t have to <em>like</em> the main character, but I should feel something. Without good characters or plot, there is just no draw for me to continue. Maybe some great stuff happens later on, but with nothing at the halfway mark, it’s hard to see my way to the finish. I need something to get me to keep reading and this book isn’t offering anything at all.</p>

<p>In addition to the plot and character woes, this book also hit a lot of my story pet peeves. First off, it is just <em>so</em> cliche!!!  Orphan girl has crappy home, they want to marry her off so she escapes. She gets to school and immediately bumps into her stunningly handsome, rich and privileged arch-rival. She is the country bumpkin who must struggle to prove to her teachers, class, and herself that she deserves to be there as much as he and all the other nobles do.</p>

<p>A few days into school and Runin’s womanhood gets in the way of her studying/training - which she does to an entirely obsessive &amp; unhealthy degree. So to solve the problem she takes a drug to destroy her womb and become sterile. (Yes, that’s a pet peeve, why can’t we be women and be awesome too?) The aloof, <em>master</em> of lore, doesn’t show up to teach class (Rothfuss, Name of the Wind flashback) and of course she ends of winning him over and studying under him. While it isn’t quite the same, I can’t help but think Hunger Games while reading this, and that does not help it rise in my esteem.</p>

<p>I put the book on hold again, so when it is up for grabs again I will <em>consider</em> giving it a second go, but I find that the more I think about it, the more tempted I am to just let it slip away unfinished.</p>
