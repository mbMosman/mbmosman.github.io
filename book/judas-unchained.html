    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I kicked things into overdrive over the last week just to get this booger finished. I’ve got other things I want to read, and this 1000+ page beast was in the way! So let me echo my thoughts from the previous book… this book needed WAY more editing.</p>

<p>The overall story is OK, but it is weighed down with so much extra stuff that gets lost and really doesn’t matter. It’s exhausting to read, and feels like a chore at times. By the end of this volume, I became very, very good at skimming <em>huge</em> chunks at a time to find bits that actually contributed to the plot or character development.</p>

<p>There are some interesting ideas here, the Prime aliens are interesting &amp; different. Maybe the idea has been played out elsewhere too, but with the small amount of scifi that I’ve read over the last 10 years or so, they felt new to me. The Silfen too were a kinda interesting mismash of fantasy lore w/ scifi aliens. The worlds of the Commonwealth also felt varied while still feeling human-influenced. I appreciated those aspect of the story.</p>

<p>On the other hand I think the women in the story got the short-end of the stick by far. The few women that really matter in any meaningful way don’t do it without help. Paula Myo, champion investigator is genetically modified in order to do her job so well. Melanie is helped by the SI and otherwise makes her way through the world strictly on her attractiveness. Then there’s Justine, who pulls some things together while ruining others, but overall she is a pretty pathetic character, who believes little in herself, giving us little reason to think much of her either. The president of the commonwealth, also a woman, Elain Doi, is not only unliked pretty universally, but it’s made quite clear she has little real power or influence and is nothing more than a figurehead.</p>

<p>There were a lot of characters in this story, and it’s not like there weren’t crappy male roles too. However by the end of 2000 pages, this was enough to really ruin my mood - especially with Melanie’s constant sexual involvement. I had really hoped that she might grow out of that a bit and become a more meaningful character on her own. But no, even at the end she runs off with Orion to wrap things up with more sex for the sake of sex. Please don’t get me wrong here… there can be places for characters like that, and I’ve no problem with her sexuality. It is more that she was the one woman who had a chance to be a little more, and never lived up to it. She played the <em>dumb blonde bimbo</em> right up to the very end.</p>

<p>So, character failures and editing aside, overall the story was OK. I don’t know that things overall would hold up to much scrutiny, and several <em>big</em> things do seem a little far fetched or too convenient - for example the Starflyer’s ability to stay hidden while taking over some people while leaving so many others untouched for them to be its enemy. Another would be Bose (or his memories) to miraculously survive and get free through some Prime motile… Still to make a story, I suppose some of these things need to happen or you’ve got no plot. They bothered me less while reading and more in retrospect so I suppose I can forgive.</p>

<p>The one thing I keep coming back to though is that for the length and the investment of time it took to read these two books I expected more in return. I don’t expect to take a lot away from reading them, and I’m also not sure that they did much to push me back into reading more scifi.</p>
