    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I’m super excited to be reading this again! I read these earlier from the Japanese manga with scanned translations, and meant to come back to it now that they’ve been published in English, but just never did. The manga is significantly longer than one might expect from the original anime series, which is how I was introduced to it, so it would have been quite the investment, and having already read them… well I was being cheap. Especially since this has been on of my absolute favorite series ever since. I want a poster for “Everything important I learned from Fruits Basket”. For now, this is the best I could find <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rice-ball-in-fruits-basket">7 Lessons I Learned From “Fruits Basket”</a>. It’s actually a pretty good list, but maybe as I read through this again, I’ll make my own.</p>

<p>It’s also cool to be re-reading this as the <a href="/vizmedia/fruits-basket-2019.html">new anime series</a> is coming out. Since I’m watching it with Christy, I can’t just dive in every week, so this will help fill me up in between her weekends in MN.</p>

<hr />

<p>First, the let me say that I love the Collector’s Edition volumes that I’ve picked up. They are beautiful and the covers and special artwork is both beautiful and heart-warming. They’re also quite a bit bigger, but make the entire collection a bit more manageable for my space.</p>

<p>On to the story itself, I really can’t say enough how much I love this series. The characters feel so real, while at the same time they are clearly <em>not</em>. (How many people do you know turn into an animal when hugged?) Their emotions, struggles and friendships are so genuine. I admire Tohru’s ability to be both independent and vulnerable. She struggles to keep her chin up and persevere, maintaining a cheery face for the outside world, while also leaning on her friends for support. While she doesn’t want to be a burden, life isn’t something we can make it through alone.</p>

<p>We meet Uo &amp; Hana, Tohru’s best friends, and we also meet a small number of the Sohma family characters throughout this volume. Shigure (the dog), Yuki (the rat), and of course my favorite Kyo (the outsider cat) pop up in the beginning. Then towards the middle we meet Kagura (the boar) and Momiji (the rabbit). To wrap things up in the end there is Hatori (the dragon). Through out it all there is the somewhat mysterious and looming presence of Akito, the head of the family, who we see only briefly and learn little about.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite moments of the entire story are collected in here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The conversation Kyo &amp; Shigure have when Kyo skips out of his first day at school after blowing up at Tohru.</li>
  <li>Tohru’s rice ball revelation - It’s hard to see the good qualities in ourselves cuz they are on our backs like the plum on a rice ball. However it is easy to see those good qualities in others.</li>
  <li>Yuki and Kyo bringing Tohru back “home” from her grandfather’s house.</li>
  <li>Yuki &amp; Tohru’s conversation about being “cute”.</li>
  <li>The story of Hatori and Kana, which makes me so sad/happy I nearly cry every time.</li>
</ul>
