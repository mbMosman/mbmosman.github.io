    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>After watching American Gods, I had a desire to do a little re-reading of both that book and this one, as the idea of belief shaping reality is an interesting theme, and I couldn’t really recall how that played into this story. Turns out it doesn’t much, at least not in the way I thought I remembered.</p>

<p>That part aside, I didn’t enjoy the re-read as much as thought. I recall being really enamored with the story when I was younger. It’s hard to read a book where women have so little role outside of being pleasing to men. It’s nice to see that they can enjoy sex for their own sake, but argh. I get that the book was written in a different time, and I can appreciate that the book pushed the status quo of the time in many areas while still being disappointed that Margrethe couldn’t have had more smarts displayed throughout the story.</p>

<p>Despite disappointing women’s roles however, I think like the re-told Job story. I love seeing the changes in Alec as he goes from a strict Bible-thumping, heaven-bound soul to a saint in heaven who jumps ship for hell to find the woman he loves. It’s thoughtfully told. I love his inner rationalizations which get crazier and crazier as his slide progress. There are also some great jabs at what I like to think of as crazier religious beliefs - Does the earth from space look flat to the “flat-earthers”?, the world is only x number of years old but god made it with fossils and such to look older just to mess with people, etc.</p>
