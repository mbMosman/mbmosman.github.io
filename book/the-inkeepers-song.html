    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I thought that this was overall very well done. It doesn’t have the most exciting plot nor is it in a rush to get through it. However where some books makes it seem that you are missing something, this one makes it clear you’re listening to a story being told so it feels better to just sit back and enjoy the ride. We meet characters along the way and they add they add to the telling of the story in their own voice, as if we’re all sitting around a table enjoying ourselves, and I did very much enjoy their story.</p>

<p>At about the halfway point, I was beginning to question if I was correct about the book being published in 1993. It was indeed, and it surprised me that the story ended up feeling so modern. I feel like there are still some tells, but the women are strong characters who are capable on their own but stronger together. <span class="spoiler">Yes, one ends up being a man glamored into a disguise, but he also seems uncertain as to where the disguise ends…</span> It was also kinda nice for once to see some of the men swooning after our heroines hoping to be of some use, instead of having that be the more commonly seen reverse.  Anyhow, I was just surprised to find this all done so smoothly and transparently in a book from 1993.</p>
