    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>So, I guess one would classify this as scifi because of the time-travel oddness that happens, but it’s really more of a historical fiction. I was somewhat surprised to learn that this book was initially written in 1979. It feels so modern.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I found this to be a rather quick, but very enjoyable read. I was glad that I didn’t get too far the first night I picked it up, as it was pretty hard to put down later on. This too was surprising for me, as I picked this up because I felt like I <em>should</em> read it, more so than I wanted to read it, but honestly it’s such a good book that I would totally read it again. I will probably ending buying a copy for my own little library,</p>

<p>There were some tough subjects in here, which shouldn’t be surprising since the main character is a black woman who is yanked back in time to antebellum Maryland. (In case you too aren’t entirely sure what that means, antebellum refers to pre Civil War.) Dana has some very tough choices to make and as you learn right away in the Prologue she doesn’t come through the experience whole. The book deals with slavery, abuse, beatings, rape, but it deals with these topics quite well. It is all central to the story and plot and never feels like it’s just randomly tossed in for thrills.</p>

<p>Dana struggles a lot with her feelings, who she is and <em>should</em> be, throughout the book, and as a reader you feel that struggle too. The writing makes her thoughts, feelings, and inner conflict clear through her conversations and interactions with others. There are no easy wins in this book, and truly a lot of losses, but there is a thread of hope wover throught the whole. Somehow out of all the madness, a little girl, Dana’s ancestor, was born, and whatever circumstances surrounded those lives in the past, without those happenings Dana wouldn’t have the life she enjoys in the present. Sorting that out at the beginning sets Dana (and you as a reader) up to look for the positives, and that makes the harder parts of the book a little more bearable.</p>

<p>The version of the book that I read included a critical review &amp; reader’s guide with questions. I nosed through those a bit, but while the review was a bit more interesting - some people clearly take this book very seriously - the questions in the readers guide seemed academic &amp; sterile after the rather poignant climax and ending of the book. I’d prefer to have a copy of the book without that. I find it hard to believe someone would finish it and not have a their own set of thoughts and questions to reflect back over, though I’m also not reading this for say a Lit class. I guess I should be happy that implies that other are, though I hope they appreciate the beauty of the story told here for reasons beyond an assignment.</p>

<p>PS. If anyone makes it back in time to the late 80’s-90’s, please tell the younger version of me, that there truly are some gems to be found in English/American Lit class. Also, I’d like a heads up that I will later come to appreciate Ms Ridenhour’s friendliness with the banned book list. (As far as I know this isn’t a commonly banned/challenged book, but seems that nearly all my HS reading was. Way to go Ms. R!!!) Oh, and a little nudge about Amazon &amp; Apple would be greatly appreciated too. ;-)</p>
