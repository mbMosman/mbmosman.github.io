    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since I read the earlier books in the series, but I appreciate that I was able to jump right back in and not feel like I’ve forgotten everything. The characters were memorable and interesting enought that it wasn’t difficult to pick things back up with them. I wouldn’t have been able to recall all the story lines independently, but as each popped up it was easy enough to hop right back in. I think that speaks well for the story.</p>

<p>I believe I caught a note that this was the last of this series, and it certainly felt that way at the end. A lot of different storys and plotlines came together and seemed to resolve themselves. It’s left in a place that could be picked up again to continue some or all of them, without leaving things feeling unresolved. Some of these were wrapped up more neatly than others. Dorrin’s storyline &amp; Kieri’s for example tidied up nicely. Things seemed a bit easy at the end in some ways, but not <em>too</em> much so. On the other hand things with Dragon, Mikeli, Camwyn, Arvid, and Arcolin feel less settled.</p>

<p>I do feel like some of these storylines were long and drawn out through this series, and would love to see the story shift toward some of the other characters. Kieri was OK, but the whole thing with the elves &amp; old humans, never really grabbed at me in the way similar pulled-between two worlds stories have. I don’t find myself particularly interested in his lovely wife &amp; children either. On the other hand I’m quite intrigued by the Gird Marshal-General’s struggle with the revival of magic and Arvid’s calling. Arcolin’s role as a gnome prince is also interesting, though Camwyn’s story leaves the most open and up for grabs. I would be quite likely to continue with a new series to see where things go.</p>
