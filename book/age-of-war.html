    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>Wow… Definitely got hit with a lot of didn’t see that coming. I haven’t read any of the other books outside of this trilogy, so unlike others who might have insight into what comes later from the books published earlier but chronologically fall later in the timeline, I didn’t have any insight into where things might end up. Overall though, I’m not sure it would have mattered. Even at the end of this trilogy, what the larger outcome might be is still cloudy to me. I imagine that trying to work backwards to the outcome here wouldn’t be so easy for those who read the earlier books.</p>

<p>Anyhow all that aside, I really liked the characters, and how much they all - well maybe one exception (Nyphron, I’m looking at you) - evolved over the course of the overall story. There were no easy wins for anyone, and all their challenges were pretty unique. There are voices here that aren’t your run of the mill, cliched fantasy characters. Their personalities all shine through the writing.</p>

<p>On the whole, this series was awesome. Definitely one of the best reads for the year, and a new addition to my favorites. Each story was relatively complete for a book in a trilogy, and the whole came together perfectly in the end. I will say though, that the build up to the end of this last volume of the trilogy was pretty intense. I was really glad that I had books two &amp; three to read together back to back, despite the having a good break point.</p>

<p>Supposedly there is a new trilogy coming that picks up where this one leaves off. I’m excited to dive into it, but’s not <em>all</em> released yet, so I will probably wait until I can read all three books together, but it will be a little tough to wait. I’m definitely on board now for reading the entire overarching Riyria series.</p>
