    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>I was overall pretty pleased by this book, though at the end I was disappointed to find that the story is continued in another volume. This might turn out to be OK, but I really wish things had just wrapped up in this one book. I’m not entirely convinced that the characters and plot are strong enough to carry through what appears to be a trilogy.</p>

<p>This book sucked me in with myth and mystery, alongside some fairly cool and unconventional characters. Temur gets some bonus points from me for his awesome archery skills, horseback no less. There’s also an interesting twist here for the wizards in that they must give up their ability to create life to work magic. That seems like it could make for some interesting story. There’s also a tiger lady, Hrahima, who seems interesting, though she remains mostly mysterious, only serving as some needed muscle to pull through a few tougher spots.  Perhaps the most surprising character though is Temur’s faithful mount, Bansch, who seems to be a bit more than just a horse.</p>

<p>I was drawn into the world quickly, there are some interesting ideas in the world and characters. However I am a little concerned about the ability of all this to still be interesting another volume or two in. The plot and conflict brewing just doesn’t seem strong enough to me, but I hope to be proven wrong. I’m going to aim for optimism, and have put a hold on the next volume from the library.</p>
