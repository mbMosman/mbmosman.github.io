  <section class="review">
    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>First, I want to say that things of this nature - books, articles, shows, anything - can be hard for me. I have a tendency to just get angry about it. I mean, I’ve lived and worked in tech for a <em>long</em> time now. It’s been a big part of my life, and having to acknowledge and deal with the darker side of it brings back stories and events that I’ve experienced and brushed aside to keep trooping through doing my job.</p>

<p>However, while some of that surfaced a bit here and there throughout parts of this book, I did not find that it was making me angry in the ways that I expected. I think that is in large part due to the presentation. This books does not rant or just point out how <em>wrong</em> things are. It digs into why things are that way without being too heavy handed with blame. (Don’t get me wrong, there is blame, but it’s coated with a dollop of if not positive intent, then human intent.) Instead of painting tech companies as <em>evil</em> they come across more as just short-sited… OK, so I’m maybe softening it a bit too much. The point is that it takes a pretty reasonable approach to explaining why things are the way they are, without demonizing.</p>

<p>There are a lot of really great snippets in here, which I should probably go back and pull out some notes on before I return it…</p>

<p>Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this to everyone, as we are all interfacing so much with tech these days that these topics are things to be aware of regardless of who you are. I think some people might brush some of this off as it works for <em>most</em>, but there’s a really good argument made here that this is not true. It might be eye-opening in ways you do not expect.</p>

<p>If you work in tech in any way, shape or form, or if you would consider yourself entreprenurial, then I think this is a <strong>must</strong> read. You need to make sure that you are aware of these issues and can avoid being part of what seems like a growing problem. I don’t think there’s any excuse for ignorance at this point in time. Make yourself aware of the issues and do your best to improve things.</p>
