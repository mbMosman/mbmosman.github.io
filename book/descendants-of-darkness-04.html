    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>So this volume starts off with the ministry’s vacation to Hokkaido and (of course) a <em>hot springs</em>. Sigh… All these hot springs vacations in anime and manga are certainly doing a great marketing job for hot springs. I really wanna go visit one now! But on the other hand I find myself eye-rolling at all the typical hot springs jokes &amp; banter. It did catch me off guard however when a talking rabbit, fox, and alligator show up and enlist the crew to hunt down the missing snow queen. Tied in with this is an archery competition, which you’d think would earn some brownie points with me as I really like archery. However add in a guy that turns into some demon dog monster when he touches a woman, and a <em>girlish</em> partner whose job it is just to turn him back, and a pranked target that says you must French kiss one of your teammates if you hit it and UGH! Enough already!</p>

<p>The last few chapters have them looking for a lost soul from a murder at an all boy’s school. The whole plot in this story is just screwy. It seems like hacked together non-sense just to get some overt boy-love scandal in. There’s some demon who is supposedly the mastermind of it all just to lure Tsuzuki there to challenge him for his new role as the ruler of dragons?! I mean I remember this fight from earlier, but this totally comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. There’s also a woman demon-hunter disguised as one of the boy-students, who sneaks in on Hisoka while he’s sleeping and attacks him, then turns all buddy buddy and explains the demon-power-challenge thing with Tsuzuki. Sorry if that makes not sense, but reading it didn’t make any sense to me, so how can I explain any more clearly… sigh…</p>

<p>Bottom line is that I quit here.  The stories seem to be more supernatural mystery / crime fighting  than I care for, and I’m really not digging the storylines or the characters. I expected death, I mean they’re working for some underworld ministry, but this is gory death. There’s also a lot of boy-love undertones and overt overtones, which would bother me less if it weren’t portrayed as abusive and wrong. I suppose that is a mark of the time to some extent as this was originally written in the late 90’s, but it still bothers me to see it. Between Dr. Muraki in the last volume and the Catholic boy’s school murders in this one, it’s just too much a theme for me to want to continue with these stories. Oddly enough in the side notes, Matsushita says something along the lines of “I write what I like, if you don’t like it read something else”, and so I shall.</p>
