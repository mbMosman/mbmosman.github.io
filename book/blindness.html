    <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>So my feelings on this overall are mixed… It’s not something I would have typically chosen so I may be a little harsher because of that. It paints a view of humanity at some of its worst, and that triggers inner dialog of believing and not believing we could ever really be like that. Perhaps it also hits harder in our political climate of today…</p>

<p>The writing style really rubbed me the wrong way too. There are sometimes page long blocks of text, not broken down into sentences that are often hard to follow. That made it particularly hard to read over breaks or when I might need to put it down more abruptly.</p>

<p>It is also dirty, in a literal dirt/filth/slop sense. People are living in filth, because of the state of things. I like to imagine and visualize what I read and this is an intensely ugly world to imagine. It’s gross to imagine the dead rotting in the streets, being eaten by animals. There is brutal gang rape, resulting in a woman’s death, and resultant revenge murders which, deserved or not, are equally ugly.</p>

<p>I was definitely sucked into the story. However, I think what I’d like to see more of to make it feel more worth the while would be more interesting questions of why characters might behave a particular way or do a certain thing. Most of the cast felt pretty flat and stereotypical. Despite going blind and having mass chaos around them, they seemed mostly unchanged throughout. The women talk about having been raped and how that changes a person, but I didn’t see or feel that change in them. I can’t really say if that was just lost in translation, but regardless I had expected something more and didn’t get it.</p>
